Led by Nashville musician and Greenville fan favorite Maia Sharp, these intimate sessions of stories and songs feature a rotating lineup of guest songwriters each month. This is the place to be for anyone who deeply connects with music and enjoys tales about the musician\'s life.\nThis session has a lot of musical-influence wild cards and can go anywhere. Buckle up as Maia Sharp drives this multi-faceted music journey with genre-defying songwriter David Ryan Harris and literary master lyricist Adam Wright.\nABOUT MAIA SHARP\nMaia Sharp has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, Keb’ Mo’ (including his recent single \"Junkyard Dog\" with Taj Mahal) and Trisha Yearwood (including her recent single “The Wall or the Way Over”) and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums; nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock and her duo project, Roscoe & Etta. Maia is also an adjunct professor at NYU and has been writing for Songwriting With: Soldiers for eight years. Her latest album Tomboy was released in September 2025.\nABOUT DAVID RYAN HARRIS\nDavid Ryan Harris is a genre-defying singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose blend of soul, folk, rock, and R&B has earned him a devoted following. He has toured and recorded with artists like John Mayer, India.Arie, and Dave Matthews, while his solo work showcases introspective songwriting and vocal depth. As a writer and producer, he’s contributed to hit songs such as “Battle Scars” (Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco) and “Just a Dream” (Nelly) and continues to release solo projects that highlight his versatility and emotional range.\nABOUT ADAM WRIGHT\nAdam Wright writes “songs about people,” as he states in his utterly gut wrenching and masterfully written song “The Banker” from his second solo album Dust. A true singer/songwriter, Wright colors in the shapes of characters so numerous and diverse you’d need a series of novels to tell their full stories.

        detail: "Welcome to Song Sessions, your brand-new singer-songwriter concert series in The Mockingbird. Led by Nashville musician and Greenville fan favorite Maia Sharp, these intimate sessions of stories and songs feature a rotating lineup of guest songwriters each month. This is the place to be for anyone who deeply connects with music and enjoys tales about the musician\'s life.\nThis session has a lot of musical-influence wild cards and can go anywhere. Buckle up as Maia Sharp drives this multi-faceted music journey with genre-defying songwriter David Ryan Harris and literary master lyricist Adam Wright.\nABOUT MAIA SHARP\nMaia Sharp has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, Keb’ Mo’ (including his recent single \"Junkyard Dog\" with Taj Mahal) and Trisha Yearwood (including her recent single “The Wall or the Way Over”) and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums; nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock and her duo project, Roscoe & Etta. Maia is also an adjunct professor at NYU and has been writing for Songwriting With: Soldiers for eight years. Her latest album Tomboy was released in September 2025.\nABOUT DAVID RYAN HARRIS\nDavid Ryan Harris is a genre-defying singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose blend of soul, folk, rock, and R&B has earned him a devoted following. He has toured and recorded with artists like John Mayer, India.Arie, and Dave Matthews, while his solo work showcases introspective songwriting and vocal depth. As a writer and producer, he’s contributed to hit songs such as “Battle Scars” (Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco) and “Just a Dream” (Nelly) and continues to release solo projects that highlight his versatility and emotional range.\nABOUT ADAM WRIGHT\nAdam Wright writes “songs about people,” as he states in his utterly gut wrenching and masterfully written song “The Banker” from his second solo album Dust. A true singer/songwriter, Wright colors in the shapes of characters so numerous and diverse you’d need a series of novels to tell their full stories. With two Grammy nominations under his belt (\"So You Don\'t Have To Love Me\" - Best Country Song/Alan Jackson, \"All The Trouble\" - Best American Roots Song/Lee Ann Womack), Wright continues to be a songwriter\'s songwriter. His songs have been recorded by Nashville giants like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Lee Ann Womack as well as lyric luminaries like Robert Earl Keen, Brandy Clark, and Bruce Robison.

From their early days as a forward-thinking bluegrass band unafraid to add drums and blend wildly different styles, to their role as pioneers of the modern jam-band scene, Leftover Salmon has remained a vital force in American roots music. They’ve helped preserve tradition while pushing it forward with a sound that’s uniquely their own, earning their place as elder statesmen who loom large over festivals nationwide.\n\nLeftover Salmon recently paid tribute to the late Bob Weir by performing The Grateful Dead\'s \"Playing in the Band.\"\nThe band’s current lineup—its longest-running and one of its strongest—centers on founding members Drew Emmitt and Vince Herman, joined by banjo standout Andy Thorn, bassist Greg Garrison, drummer Alwyn Robinson, and dobro player and keyboardist Jay Starling. For more than three decades, Leftover Salmon has never stood still. A live show is a masterclass in Americana, moving effortlessly from front-porch bluegrass to Cajun grooves, New Orleans swagger, Nashville reverence, and Colorado mountain psychedelia—often all in the same night.",

        detail: "Led by the lyrical craftsmanship of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Clint Roberts, the distinctly Appalachian, old-time sound of Asheville’s Holler Choir combines haunting harmonies, stirring string compositions, and heart-wrenching ballads, yet hardly conforms to a stereotypical genre. Call it a confluence of old-time, Americana, and bluegrass, but, by its own exceptional design, the sound and atmosphere of Holler Choir are singular. Robert’s wordcraft and explosive vocal range is met with the dulcet clawhammer banjo plucking of long-time collaborator Helena Rose and the sturdy timekeeping of upright bassist Norbert McGettigan. With a rotating cast of gifted musicians featured on Holler Choir’s recordings and electrifying live performances, it’s no wonder they are the band to watch in 2023. \nThe band’s inception began when recording Robert’s 2022 solo release, entitled “Mountain Air”. That fortuitous collaboration of gifted roots musicians at Asheville’s Crossroads Studios proved to be the genesis of an unmistakable new sound built on that shared experience. Produced by Grammy award-winning multi-instrumentalist, Michael Ashworth, of The Steep Canyon Rangers, the five-song EP lit the fuse and Holler Choir was well on its way to delight audiences throughout the southeast and beyond. \nFor their debut full-length record, “Songs Before They Write Themselves,” Holler Choir again teamed up with producer Michael Ashworth. Set for release in summer of 2023, the album was tracked in the historic Echo Mountain Studio’s church room and boasts the engineering prowess of Jason Richmond (Avett Brothers, Rising Appalachia), and was mastered by Grammy Award-winning engineer, Kim Rosen. \nAccording to Roberts “Holler Choir” could be a double entendre. A choir that hollers, or a choir from the hollers of western North Carolina. What their sound and vision exude leaves the meaning up to you.",

Raised in the sacred steel tradition of the House of God Church, he cut his teeth alongside his uncles and cousins in The Lee Boys, forging a reputation for raw, soul-shaking live shows that blur the line between revival and rock show. Launching his solo career in 2012, “The Dr.” now commands the stage from the front, flooring crowds with lightning-fast slide work, deep-pocket groove, dynamically capturing and fearless improvisation. Touring nationally with his own band, Collier has ignited stages in over 50 countries across 6 continents. His debut album, Exit 16 (2018), produced by Michael League, distills blues, gospel, rock, and swampy funk into a sound that’s tells “Who I Am and Where I’m Going.”",

        detail: "Pretty Little Goat is grassroots music at its finest. The band formed in 2013 through their common grounding in the deep well of local tradition found in the mountains of Western North Carolina. As young lovers of old-time music, Pretty Little Goat began winning string band competitions right away. Over the last 13 years, the band has developed a unique sound, writing music inspired by the mountains and the musical traditions therein.\nMembers of the band are dedicated mentors to the next generation of musicians. Always looking for new and exciting ways to inspire young people, they have been deeply involved in the local JAM (Junior Appalachian Musicians) program, music camps, schools and more.\nJosh Carter- Mandolin\nOwen Grooms- Banjo\nMallory Carter- Percussion\nJonathan Gray- Bass\nJackson Dulaney- Dobro\nBrian VanAntwerp- Fiddle\nPretty Little Goat sees traditional music is a living art form; vibrant and evolving. Their debut self-titled album released in 2016 presents unique interpretations of old-time songs and tunes along with original material. The Goats’ second album, “Let The Sun Shine In”, is full of groovy original music that is “as close as we will ever be to our past while being as current as we need it to be” (Mike Ashworth, Steep Canyon Rangers).\nThe Goat’s third album, “Big Storm”, continues the saga with an album of catchy original and traditional music that is sure to stick with you. Most recently, “Southland” is an album where the band has really started to hit their stride. Includes a whole slew of new, catchy, original songs and tunes, mixed with traditional fiddle music featuring Madeline Dierauf of The Wilder Flower",

Yet in all that time, EYB never forgot its roots, and today the foursome reclaim the spirit behind their success.\nSome of their biggest hits include:\n\n\nCrazy Girl (4× Platinum)\n\n\nEven If It Breaks Your Heart\n\n\nSkinny Little Thing\n\n\nLove Ain’t\n\n\n\n\n\nLANCO\nCheck out LANCO’s chart-topping, 3× Platinum love anthem ‘Greatest Love Story’.\n\n\n\nWe’re Gonna Make It\nBrandon Lancaster is confident that we’re all going to reach the hilltop — we just have to keep going. LANCO convincingly deliver that message on their new album We’re Gonna Make It, the Nashville band’s follow-up to their Number One country debut, Hallelujah Nights, and their first for Riser House Records.\nSome of their biggest hits include:\n\n\nGreatest Love Story\n\n\nBorn to Love You\n\n\nModern Day Drifter\n\n\nBest Worst Mistake\n\n\n“Country music has always had a lot of pain in it,” says Lancaster, who founded the multi-platinum-selling band in 2015. “When I’m writing a song, I acknowledge that pain, but I also believe in restoration and redemption, and I wanted to explore that on this record.”",

        detail: "Celebrated cellist, songwriter and storyteller Ben Sollee is back with a fresh perspective and a new collection of songs. His upcoming album, Time On Hold, is set for global streaming release on February 27, 2026. This record serves as a vibrant follow-up to his 2024 full-length Long Haul and his recent, atmospheric EP Common Ghosts, marking a prolific period of creative renewal for the Kentucky artist.\nWhile Long Haul navigated the personal terrain of recovery and physical resilience, Time On Hold turns its gaze outward. The album finds Sollee leaning into a soulful, country-inflected sound that captures the warmth of his live performances. Drawing on influences from Willie Nelson to Phoebe Snow, it is a record that feels both grounded in tradition and keenly aware of the modern world\'s complexities.\nExplore Ben Sollee\'s new single and music catalog ⬇️\n\nThe journey began on January 16, 2026, with the release of the first single, \"Algorithmic Whispers.\" A standout track that anchors the album\'s narrative, the song explores the friction of maintaining human connection in a \"post-truth,\" AI-infused landscape. With his signature blend of folky cello and thoughtful lyricism, Sollee examines how we find our own rhythm when digital forces are constantly trying to set the pace for us.\nThe 10-track album features eight re-imagined fan favorites from Sollee\'s catalog, alongside two new songs.\nRecorded at Swingfingers Studios, the album features a tight-knit ensemble including Bradley Morse (bass), Kevin Matthews (drums), Brandon Coleman and Eric Wiggs (guitar) and Spencer Zweifel (keys/organ). Together, they\'ve crafted a sound that is confident and intentional - capturing the \"traveling groove\" that has become a hallmark of Sollee\'s work.",

Led by Nashville musician and Greenville fan favorite Maia Sharp, these intimate sessions of stories and songs feature a rotating lineup of guest songwriters each month. This is the place to be for anyone who deeply connects with music and enjoys tales about the musician\'s life.\nThis trio of Tennessee-based musicians set up straight out of Nashville for an unforgettable evening of industry tales and songs that\'ll stay in your head for days. Maia Sharp hosts powerhouse songwriters Emma-Lee and Terra Lynne for this girls-night-in concert you won\'t want to miss.\nABOUT MAIA SHARP\nMaia Sharp has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, Keb’ Mo’ (including his recent single \"Junkyard Dog\" with Taj Mahal) and Trisha Yearwood (including her recent single “The Wall or the Way Over”) and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums; nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock and her duo project, Roscoe & Etta. Maia is also an adjunct professor at NYU and has been writing for Songwriting With: Soldiers for eight years. Her latest album Tomboy was released in September 2025.\nABOUT EMMA-LEE\nBorn in Toronto, Emma-Lee is a songwriter and artist now based in Nashville, Tennessee, signed to Sony Music Publishing and RareSpark Media Group. Most recently she’s co-written songs for Trisha Yearwood, Mickey Guyton, Pentatonix, Mackenzie Porter, Rachel Platten, Mitchell Tenpenny, Tenille Arts, Madeline Edwards, Meghan Patrick, Ross Ellis, Brett Kissel, Tim Hicks, The Washboard Union, Shawn Hook, Melanie Dyer, Sacha, and many more — resulting in over 150 cuts, numerous Top 40 radio singles, and two number ones.\nABOUT TERA LYNNE\nWith fiery red hair and powerhouse vocals, Americana artist Tera Lynne commands a presence. The Nashville-based singer-songwriter and St. Louis native has spent the last decade honing her craft on a global stage, opening for the likes of Thomas Rhett and headlining festivals like Switzerland’s Badenfahrt folk fest. Her single “Born to Rock (Gotta Roll)” held a 7-day No. 1 streak on the Amazon Country Digital Sales Chart, further solidifying her momentum. Citing inspiration from Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, and The Band, Tera Lynne’s soul, cheek, and grit combine the best of country and classic rock with a modern irreverence that’s earned her praise from CMT, Cowboys and Indians, Forbes, and more.",

While the record marks the group’s first release with newest member Addie Levy, the result is quintessential Brothers Comatose: a warm, joyful reflection on identity and the ties that bind from a band that knows exactly who they are (and exactly where they come from).\nFounded by Ben and Alex Morrison in 2008, The Brothers Comatose first emerged from San Francisco with their 2010 debut, Songs from The Stoop, which helped earn dates with the likes of Gillian Welch & David Rawlings, Greensky Bluegrass, and Trampled by Turtles. In the decade-and-a-half that followed, the critically acclaimed quintet would go on to release five more full-length LPs, rack up nearly 50 million streams, land festival slots at Outside Lands, High Sierra, and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, tour with Lake Street Dive, The Devil Makes Three, and Yonder Mountain String Band, and build up a devoted following thanks to their raucous live shows and relentless schedule.",

Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Watts blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy, wowing audiences with performances that are 100% improvised. \nHe was recently the DJ at the 2021 Emmy Awards, which saw a 15% ratings boost from 2020. \nWatts’ first Netflix special Spatial released to massive critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it “a giddy rush of escapist nonsense” and dubbing Watts “the most influential absurdist in comedy today.” The A.V. Club described Spatial as “signature Watts, meaning it’s alternately exhilarating, silly, exhausting and transcendent,” and Exclaim! Magazine called his performance “engaging, absurd, thoughtful and, most importantly, wholly unpredictable.”\nAs a solo performer, Watts brand of musical/comedy fusion has led to sold out headlining tours in the U.S. and Europe, including festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, Just For Laughs, Pemberton and more.\nIn 2020, Watts released his own content app called, WattsApp, a techno-savvy look into his life, work, and techno junk drawer. WattsApp has all original content including a show called, Droneversations where he interviews guests while it’s filmed by drones along with other fun content.\nIn 2010, Watts released his debut comedy special, Why Shit So Crazy? on Comedy Central Records, and is now available to stream on Netflix. Why Shit So Crazy? featured Watts in live performances at New York venues such as Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and Le Poisson Rouge, bookended with brief sketches and music videos. Later that year, at the invitation of Jack White, Watts recorded Reggie Watts: Live at Third Man Records which was released in limited edition vinyl. In 2012, Watts recorded his second comedy special, Reggie Watts: A Live at Central Park, which was released by Comedy Central.\nReggie’s memoir, Great Falls, MT will be published on October 17th, 2023, by Penguin’s highly curated Tiny Reparations imprint.\nWatts was born in Germany, raised in Montana, and currently resides in Los Angeles.",

The result is a “multi-dimensional rock” identity that has continuously evolved over the past decade, as the band members themselves - Ben Stevens (vocals, keys), Christian Rose (vocals, violin), Kamau Burton (vocals, guitar), Daniel Moss (guitar), and Rami El-Abidin (bass) - went from students at Boston College to professional touring musicians and seasoned recording artists.\nJuice’s sound may be ever-evolving, but their bold energy is evergreen: The goal, both on stage and on record, is not just to connect on a human level, but to breathe life into every room. While they pack a punch on record, Juice shine their brightest onstage, bringing their music to life for all to see, hear, and feel.

        detail: "These local bluegrass legends are making their Sierra Nevada debut this summer on the amphitheater!\nHeralds of the Carolina sound for more than two decades, Steep Canyon Rangers find themselves in a unique seat at the table for their new release, Morning Shift, released September 8, 2023. On this record, the GRAMMY-winners tell stories that both honor their roots, and expand upon the living art of bluegrass music, all while solidifying their reputation as some of the most influential songwriters in Americana today.\nThe Steep Canyon Rangers recently recorded their 14th studio album in Bat Cave, NC, at the Hickory Nut Gap Inn, a historical refuge settled near a long-forgotten crossroads of Southern Appalachia. Much like the story of bluegrass music, the conversations surrounding this area are shared, fluid, and greatly affected by a simple matter of perspective. This was the perfect space to feel confident in expanding upon that Carolina sound, the perfect runway to let their well-oiled machine do what it does best- craft stories from the ground up, as a unit.\nGraham Sharp writes of similar fluidity on the album’s opening track, “Hominy Valley,” a moving story about the layers of human history in his West Asheville neighborhood.\n“It’s not just a shared history, but a living history. Nothing is stamped and finished.” said Sharp, also likening this to the Rangers’ musical journey over the years. “We’re a product of who the band was in the past as well as who we want to be in the present and future. This recording session felt really good, because there was no pressure to be anything but ourselves in that moment. It was important that we came in without any preordained expectations about what kind of record this would be, and Darrell Scott was the perfect producer to provide guidance from an open perspective. ”\nWith a sure hand at the wheel was the distinguished Darrell Scott, whom the Rangers put full faith in to navigate the waters of producing their most important record to date. “It was like going to recording camp,” said Scott, “We ate together, we stayed at the Inn together the whole time, and we recorded. Going about it that way made for a very organic record. We had a great engineer with Dave Sinko, who could in essence create a studio space in a rustic, historic home.”\nHailing from both the Appalachian and Piedmont regions of North Carolina, the Rangers have long held traditional bluegrass paramount, while possessing an exceptional ability to bring it down the mountain, and to incorporate accessible influence from all walks of the region. With the band’s last few albums, they have gained recognition from well beyond the world of bluegrass, earning a reputation as some of the most influential songwriters in Americana today.\nNewcomer to this ship, Aaron Burdett, brings a soul-stirring element to the Rangers’ mastery of mountain music. Burdett is an award-winning singer-songwriter, and a student of folk tradition. He provides a fresh, emotional context to the songbook, which “can reach out and touch your heart or slap you in the face,” to use the praise of drummer and multi-instrumentalist, Mike Ashworth.\n“I’ve always loved traditional Old Time and Bluegrass, and the concept of neo-traditional re-visitations and interpretations of those styles.” says Burdett about the track “Above My Burdens.”\n“Once I started singing with the Rangers,” continues Burdett, “I saw an opportunity to try to write some songs for the band that brought in the traditional sounds and structures that I grew up hearing here in western North Carolina.”\nA thoughtful approach to collaboration, ironclad creative trust, and a collective drive towards authentic storytelling, makes for not only a quintessential Rangers record, but a modern North Carolina classic.\nSteep Canyon Rangers is made up of Graham Sharp on banjo and vocals, Mike Guggino on mandolin/mandola and vocals, Aaron Burdett on guitar and vocals, Nicky Sanders on fiddle and vocals, Mike Ashworth on drums and vocals, and Barrett Smith on bass, guitar, and vocals.\nOver the band’s esteemed career, the three-time Grammy nominees have released 14 studio albums, three collaborative albums with actor and banjoist Steve Martin, been inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame, and appeared on some of music’s biggest stages. In 2013, Nobody Knows You won the GRAMMY Award for Best Bluegrass Album, while 2012’s Rare Bird and 2020’s North Carolina Songbook garnered nominations in the same category.",
