Formed in 1993 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the original lineup featured Garrett Dutton (G. Love) as lead vocalist and guitarist, Jeffrey Clemens on drums, and Jim Prescott on bass. The trio quickly gained attention for their laid-back, groovy sound and G. Love’s unique vocal style, blending rap-like spoken word with bluesy singing.\nTheir self-titled debut album, G. Love & Special Sauce, was released in 1994 on Epic Records and included the breakout single “Cold Beverage.” The track became a staple on alternative radio and MTV, helping solidify the band’s presence in the music scene. Their style is often described as a blend of “slacker blues” and “alternative hip-hop,” combining 90s hip-hop rhythms with classic blues influences.\nThe video below features “Cold Beverage,” one of their debut and most well-known hit songs.",

Individually and collectively, they have soloed with the National Symphony Orchestra; the Chicago, Philadelphia, Vancouver, New Jersey, Dallas, and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras; and various other orchestras throughout the US and internationally.\nThe 5 Browns are thrilled to welcome one of their generation’s most electric pianists as a permanent member. Gold medalist at the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition and frequent soloist in concert halls around the world (including Carnegie Hall and Wigmore Hall), Stephen Beus has performed with The 5 Browns during four previous seasons.",

        detail: "Led by the lyrical craftsmanship of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Clint Roberts, the distinctly Appalachian, old-time sound of Asheville’s Holler Choir combines haunting harmonies, stirring string compositions, and heart-wrenching ballads, yet hardly conforms to a stereotypical genre. Call it a confluence of old-time, Americana, and bluegrass, but, by its own exceptional design, the sound and atmosphere of Holler Choir are singular. Robert’s wordcraft and explosive vocal range is met with the dulcet clawhammer banjo plucking of long-time collaborator Helena Rose and the sturdy timekeeping of upright bassist Norbert McGettigan. With a rotating cast of gifted musicians featured on Holler Choir’s recordings and electrifying live performances, it’s no wonder they are the band to watch in 2023. \nThe band’s inception began when recording Robert’s 2022 solo release, entitled “Mountain Air”. That fortuitous collaboration of gifted roots musicians at Asheville’s Crossroads Studios proved to be the genesis of an unmistakable new sound built on that shared experience. Produced by Grammy award-winning multi-instrumentalist, Michael Ashworth, of The Steep Canyon Rangers, the five-song EP lit the fuse and Holler Choir was well on its way to delight audiences throughout the southeast and beyond. \nFor their debut full-length record, “Songs Before They Write Themselves,” Holler Choir again teamed up with producer Michael Ashworth. Set for release in summer of 2023, the album was tracked in the historic Echo Mountain Studio’s church room and boasts the engineering prowess of Jason Richmond (Avett Brothers, Rising Appalachia), and was mastered by Grammy Award-winning engineer, Kim Rosen. \nAccording to Roberts “Holler Choir” could be a double entendre. A choir that hollers, or a choir from the hollers of western North Carolina. What their sound and vision exude leaves the meaning up to you.",

Keel, Stickley, and other modern flatpickers like Billy Strings grew up studying these legends. These masters were role models who provided inspiration to both Larry and Jon to pursue careers as professional guitar players. Each has gone on to pioneer his own distinct interpretation of the bluegrass artform, as well as fusing genres from roots, jazz, prog, and beyond. Now, Keel and Stickley have themselves become new masters of acoustic guitar. With this act, the two celebrate the pure joy of playing acoustic guitar music as a duo, effortlessly complementing each other’s rhythm and lead playing while never losing their own individual personality. Their sophisticated and awe-inspiring performances suit an array of venues including festival stages, listening rooms, private functions, and nightclubs. At the core of the Keel/Stickley Duo is an intimate conversation between two guitars and voices, done with superior skill and taste, with more than a hint of explosive late-night-jam vibe.\nStream or buy the new Larry Keel & Jon Stickley EP on your favorite platform now!",

While the record marks the group’s first release with newest member Addie Levy, the result is quintessential Brothers Comatose: a warm, joyful reflection on identity and the ties that bind from a band that knows exactly who they are (and exactly where they come from).\nFounded by Ben and Alex Morrison in 2008, The Brothers Comatose first emerged from San Francisco with their 2010 debut, Songs from The Stoop, which helped earn dates with the likes of Gillian Welch & David Rawlings, Greensky Bluegrass, and Trampled by Turtles. In the decade-and-a-half that followed, the critically acclaimed quintet would go on to release five more full-length LPs, rack up nearly 50 million streams, land festival slots at Outside Lands, High Sierra, and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, tour with Lake Street Dive, The Devil Makes Three, and Yonder Mountain String Band, and build up a devoted following thanks to their raucous live shows and relentless schedule.",

Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Watts blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy, wowing audiences with performances that are 100% improvised. \nHe was recently the DJ at the 2021 Emmy Awards, which saw a 15% ratings boost from 2020. \nWatts’ first Netflix special Spatial released to massive critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it “a giddy rush of escapist nonsense” and dubbing Watts “the most influential absurdist in comedy today.” The A.V. Club described Spatial as “signature Watts, meaning it’s alternately exhilarating, silly, exhausting and transcendent,” and Exclaim! Magazine called his performance “engaging, absurd, thoughtful and, most importantly, wholly unpredictable.”\nAs a solo performer, Watts brand of musical/comedy fusion has led to sold out headlining tours in the U.S. and Europe, including festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, Just For Laughs, Pemberton and more.\nIn 2020, Watts released his own content app called, WattsApp, a techno-savvy look into his life, work, and techno junk drawer. WattsApp has all original content including a show called, Droneversations where he interviews guests while it’s filmed by drones along with other fun content.\nIn 2010, Watts released his debut comedy special, Why Shit So Crazy? on Comedy Central Records, and is now available to stream on Netflix. Why Shit So Crazy? featured Watts in live performances at New York venues such as Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and Le Poisson Rouge, bookended with brief sketches and music videos. Later that year, at the invitation of Jack White, Watts recorded Reggie Watts: Live at Third Man Records which was released in limited edition vinyl. In 2012, Watts recorded his second comedy special, Reggie Watts: A Live at Central Park, which was released by Comedy Central.\nReggie’s memoir, Great Falls, MT will be published on October 17th, 2023, by Penguin’s highly curated Tiny Reparations imprint.\nWatts was born in Germany, raised in Montana, and currently resides in Los Angeles.",
