Hear these beloved songwriters in a special sit-down with Maia Sharp.\n\nABOUT MAIA SHARP\nMaia Sharp has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, Keb’ Mo’ (including his recent single \"Junkyard Dog\" with Taj Mahal) and Trisha Yearwood (including her recent single “The Wall or the Way Over”) and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums; nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock and her duo project, Roscoe & Etta. Maia is also an adjunct professor at NYU and has been writing for Songwriting With: Soldiers for eight years. Her latest album Tomboy was released in September 2025.\nABOUT GARY BURR\nAward-winning songwriter Gary Burr has been responsible for some of the greatest pop and country songs of the last three decades. Born in Meriden, Connecticut, he fell in love with music when he went to the original Woodstock Festival, and decided to take a shower and then start a band. A broken leg placed him in a body cast for three months, so he took that opportunity to learn the guitar and take a crash course in songwriting from the albums he had next to his bed, Carole King, Pure Prairie League and, of course, The Beatles.\nAs his career progressed he ended up working with the very artists he was inspired by... as the lead singer in Pure Prairie League replacing Vince Gill, touring the world singing and playing with Carole King, and writing six albums with Ringo Starr.\nABOUT GEORGIA MIDDLEMAN\nGeorgia Middleman’s love affair with music is evident in every song she writes. Her songs blend passion and insight into the human condition with powerful melodies in a combination that hearkens to the timelessness of classic American popular music. One of Nashville’s most accomplished singer/songwriters, Georgia has had songs recorded by Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, Terri Clark, Joe Nichols, Maia Sharp and Sheila E., among many others. Her song “When The Right One Comes Along” was featured in ABC’s TV show “Nashville” and in 2010, Keith Urban took “I’m In,” which she co-wrote with Radney Foster, to the top of the country charts. Those who have seen Georgia live, though, can attest that there is real magic in her own renditions of her songs as she wraps one of music’s most expressive voices around lovingly crafted glimpses into life and love at their most compelling.",

Since its debut, the show has inspired 22 soundtracks, including a Christmas album, which collectively sold millions of album units and single-track downloads around the world. \'NASHVILLE\' was also critically lauded with multiple Emmy®, Golden Globe® and Critics Choice award nominations.\n \n\n\n\n\nCharles Esten played Deacon Claybourne, a soulful guitarist, songwriter, and love interest whose story anchored much of the show’s heart. Esten is an actor-musician and comedian, and his time on Nashville helped spark a full-fledged music career of his own — he continues to perform, write songs, and tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClare Bowen portrayed Scarlett O\'Connor, a poet-turned-singer and songwriter who worked at the Bluebird Cafe and rose through Nashville’s music world on the show. Since then, Bowen has continued her musical path, releasing solo and collaborative albums and remaining active musically beyond the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Jackson played Avery Barkley, a rebellious musician with a “bad-boy” edge who navigated the highs and lows of fame and relationships during the series. Jackson, also a musician, has kept a foot in both acting and music since Nashville ended, including recent film work and ongoing musical output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Palladio was cast as Gunnar Scott, a sensitive, lovelorn country-music singer whose journey spanned all six seasons of the show. Following Nashville, Palladio has balanced music and acting, appearing in several film and TV projects while continuing to perform, describing the show as a career-defining blend of his passions.",

Formed in 1993 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the original lineup featured Garrett Dutton (G. Love) as lead vocalist and guitarist, Jeffrey Clemens on drums, and Jim Prescott on bass. The trio quickly gained attention for their laid-back, groovy sound and G. Love’s unique vocal style, blending rap-like spoken word with bluesy singing.\nTheir self-titled debut album, G. Love & Special Sauce, was released in 1994 on Epic Records and included the breakout single “Cold Beverage.” The track became a staple on alternative radio and MTV, helping solidify the band’s presence in the music scene. Their style is often described as a blend of “slacker blues” and “alternative hip-hop,” combining 90s hip-hop rhythms with classic blues influences.\nThe video below features “Cold Beverage,” one of their debut and most well-known hit songs.",

        detail: "Led by the lyrical craftsmanship of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Clint Roberts, the distinctly Appalachian, old-time sound of Asheville’s Holler Choir combines haunting harmonies, stirring string compositions, and heart-wrenching ballads, yet hardly conforms to a stereotypical genre. Call it a confluence of old-time, Americana, and bluegrass, but, by its own exceptional design, the sound and atmosphere of Holler Choir are singular. Robert’s wordcraft and explosive vocal range is met with the dulcet clawhammer banjo plucking of long-time collaborator Helena Rose and the sturdy timekeeping of upright bassist Norbert McGettigan. With a rotating cast of gifted musicians featured on Holler Choir’s recordings and electrifying live performances, it’s no wonder they are the band to watch in 2023. \nThe band’s inception began when recording Robert’s 2022 solo release, entitled “Mountain Air”. That fortuitous collaboration of gifted roots musicians at Asheville’s Crossroads Studios proved to be the genesis of an unmistakable new sound built on that shared experience. Produced by Grammy award-winning multi-instrumentalist, Michael Ashworth, of The Steep Canyon Rangers, the five-song EP lit the fuse and Holler Choir was well on its way to delight audiences throughout the southeast and beyond. \nFor their debut full-length record, “Songs Before They Write Themselves,” Holler Choir again teamed up with producer Michael Ashworth. Set for release in summer of 2023, the album was tracked in the historic Echo Mountain Studio’s church room and boasts the engineering prowess of Jason Richmond (Avett Brothers, Rising Appalachia), and was mastered by Grammy Award-winning engineer, Kim Rosen. \nAccording to Roberts “Holler Choir” could be a double entendre. A choir that hollers, or a choir from the hollers of western North Carolina. What their sound and vision exude leaves the meaning up to you.",

The Goats’ second album, “Let The Sun Shine In”, is full of groovy original music that is “as close as we will ever be to our past while being as current as we need it to be” (Mike Ashworth, Steep Canyon Rangers).\nThe Goat’s third album, “Big Storm”, continues the saga with an album of catchy original and traditional music that is sure to stick with you. Most recently, “Southland” is an album where the band has really started to hit their stride.

Recorded with co-producers Greg Holden and Tim Bluhm, the collection is as diverse and enthralling as the California landscape itself—at times carefree and breezy, at times wild and rugged—with lush, organic arrangements full of rich vocal harmonies and driving guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, and upright bass. While the record marks the group’s first release with newest member Addie Levy, the result is quintessential Brothers Comatose: a warm, joyful reflection on identity and the ties that bind from a band that knows exactly who they are (and exactly where they come from).\nFounded by Ben and Alex Morrison in 2008, The Brothers Comatose first emerged from San Francisco with their 2010 debut, Songs from The Stoop, which helped earn dates with the likes of Gillian Welch & David Rawlings, Greensky Bluegrass, and Trampled by Turtles. In the decade-and-a-half that followed, the critically acclaimed quintet would go on to release five more full-length LPs, rack up nearly 50 million streams, land festival slots at Outside Lands, High Sierra, and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, tour with Lake Street Dive, The Devil Makes Three, and Yonder Mountain String Band, and build up a devoted following thanks to their raucous live shows and relentless schedule.",

Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Watts blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy, wowing audiences with performances that are 100% improvised. \nHe was recently the DJ at the 2021 Emmy Awards, which saw a 15% ratings boost from 2020. \nWatts’ first Netflix special Spatial released to massive critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it “a giddy rush of escapist nonsense” and dubbing Watts “the most influential absurdist in comedy today.” The A.V. Club described Spatial as “signature Watts, meaning it’s alternately exhilarating, silly, exhausting and transcendent,” and Exclaim! Magazine called his performance “engaging, absurd, thoughtful and, most importantly, wholly unpredictable.”\nAs a solo performer, Watts brand of musical/comedy fusion has led to sold out headlining tours in the U.S. and Europe, including festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, Just For Laughs, Pemberton and more.\nIn 2020, Watts released his own content app called, WattsApp, a techno-savvy look into his life, work, and techno junk drawer. WattsApp has all original content including a show called, Droneversations where he interviews guests while it’s filmed by drones along with other fun content.\nIn 2010, Watts released his debut comedy special, Why Shit So Crazy? on Comedy Central Records, and is now available to stream on Netflix. Why Shit So Crazy?featured Watts in live performances at New York venues such as Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and Le Poisson Rouge, bookended with brief sketches and music videos. Later that year, at the invitation of Jack White, Watts recorded Reggie Watts: Live at Third Man Records which was released in limited edition vinyl. In 2012, Watts recorded his second comedy special, Reggie Watts: A Live At Central Park, which was released by Comedy Central.\nReggie’s memoir, Great Falls, MT will be published on October 17th 2023 by Penguin’s highly curated Tiny Reparations imprint.\nWatts was born in Germany, raised in Montana, and currently resides in Los Angeles.",

        detail: "These local bluegrass legends are making their Sierra Nevada debut this summer on the amphitheater!\nHeralds of the Carolina sound for more than two decades, Steep Canyon Rangers find themselves in a unique seat at the table for their new release, Morning Shift, released September 8, 2023. On this record, the GRAMMY-winners tell stories that both honor their roots, and expand upon the living art of bluegrass music, all while solidifying their reputation as some of the most influential songwriters in Americana today.\nThe Steep Canyon Rangers recently recorded their 14th studio album in Bat Cave, NC, at the Hickory Nut Gap Inn, a historical refuge settled near a long-forgotten crossroads of Southern Appalachia. Much like the story of bluegrass music, the conversations surrounding this area are shared, fluid, and greatly affected by a simple matter of perspective. This was the perfect space to feel confident in expanding upon that Carolina sound, the perfect runway to let their well-oiled machine do what it does best- craft stories from the ground up, as a unit.\nGraham Sharp writes of similar fluidity on the album’s opening track, “Hominy Valley,” a moving story about the layers of human history in his West Asheville neighborhood.\n“It’s not just a shared history, but a living history. Nothing is stamped and finished.” said Sharp, also likening this to the Rangers’ musical journey over the years. “We’re a product of who the band was in the past as well as who we want to be in the present and future. This recording session felt really good, because there was no pressure to be anything but ourselves in that moment. It was important that we came in without any preordained expectations about what kind of record this would be, and Darrell Scott was the perfect producer to provide guidance from an open perspective. ”\nWith a sure hand at the wheel was the distinguished Darrell Scott, whom the Rangers put full faith in to navigate the waters of producing their most important record to date. “It was like going to recording camp,” said Scott, “We ate together, we stayed at the Inn together the whole time, and we recorded. Going about it that way made for a very organic record. We had a great engineer with Dave Sinko, who could in essence create a studio space in a rustic, historic home.”\nHailing from both the Appalachian and Piedmont regions of North Carolina, the Rangers have long held traditional bluegrass paramount, while possessing an exceptional ability to bring it down the mountain, and to incorporate accessible influence from all walks of the region. With the band’s last few albums, they have gained recognition from well beyond the world of bluegrass, earning a reputation as some of the most influential songwriters in Americana today.\nNewcomer to this ship, Aaron Burdett, brings a soul-stirring element to the Rangers’ mastery of mountain music. Burdett is an award-winning singer-songwriter, and a student of folk tradition. He provides a fresh, emotional context to the songbook, which “can reach out and touch your heart or slap you in the face,” to use the praise of drummer and multi-instrumentalist, Mike Ashworth.\n“I’ve always loved traditional Old Time and Bluegrass, and the concept of neo-traditional re-visitations and interpretations of those styles.” says Burdett about the track “Above My Burdens.”\n“Once I started singing with the Rangers,” continues Burdett, “I saw an opportunity to try to write some songs for the band that brought in the traditional sounds and structures that I grew up hearing here in western North Carolina.”\nA thoughtful approach to collaboration, ironclad creative trust, and a collective drive towards authentic storytelling, makes for not only a quintessential Rangers record, but a modern North Carolina classic.\nSteep Canyon Rangers is made up of Graham Sharp on banjo and vocals, Mike Guggino on mandolin/mandola and vocals, Aaron Burdett on guitar and vocals, Nicky Sanders on fiddle and vocals, Mike Ashworth on drums and vocals, and Barrett Smith on bass, guitar, and vocals.\nOver the band’s esteemed career, the three-time Grammy nominees have released 14 studio albums, three collaborative albums with actor and banjoist Steve Martin, been inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame, and appeared on some of music’s biggest stages. In 2013, Nobody Knows You won the GRAMMY Award for Best Bluegrass Album, while 2012’s Rare Bird and 2020’s North Carolina Songbook garnered nominations in the same category.",
