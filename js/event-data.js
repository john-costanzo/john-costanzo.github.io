Make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands.” This powerful text is featured in the opening movement of Chichester Psalms by Leonard Bernstein.\nThe first half of the concert concludes with Dona Nobis Pacem by Ralph Vaughan Williams. This poignant work reflects on the horrors of war and offers a heartfelt plea for peace. Soloists for this piece are Kathryn Knauer, soprano, and David Parker, bass.\nThe second half opens with LUX: The Dawn from on High by Dan Forrest, a moving composition commissioned in 2018 by Gordon and Sarah Herring for the Greenville Chorale. Soloists are Lisa Barksdale, soprano, and T.J. Turner, tenor.\nClosing the program is the triumphant finale of Resurrection Symphony by Gustav Mahler. This powerful ending expresses the enduring truth that our lives continue through the legacy we leave behind. Soloists include special guest Elizabeth Bishop, mezzo-soprano, and Kathryn Knauer, soprano.\nThe Greenville Chorale will be joined by the Greenville Symphony Orchestra, with Bingham Vick, Jr. conducting his final concert.\n\n",

Jo’s uniquely relatable comedy pulls inspiration from his colorful family that has reached all kinds of people and has translated into sold-out arenas around the world.\nThe comedian continues to be one of the top 10 grossing stand-up comedians each year according to Pollstar and Billboard as he sells out and breaks sales records at some of the most prestigious venues around the world. In 2024, Koy became the first comedian to sell-out 6 shows at The Kia Forum in Los Angeles. In 2022, Koy made another dream come true when he performed and sold-out Madison Square Garden for the first time in New York City. The same year he sold-out the Climate Pledge Arena (over 14,000 tickets) in his hometown of Seattle and returned later that year to sell out the Tacoma Dome (over 22,000 tickets).
