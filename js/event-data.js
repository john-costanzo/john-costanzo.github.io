        detail: "Welcome to Song Sessions, your brand-new singer-songwriter concert series in The Mockingbird. Led by Nashville musician and Greenville fan favorite Maia Sharp, these intimate sessions of stories and songs feature a rotating lineup of guest songwriters each month. This is the place to be for anyone who deeply connects with music and enjoys tales about the musician\'s life.\nOne was inspired at Woodstock, the other is a light of Nashville--both are go-tos for a great song. Hear these beloved songwriters in a special sit-down with Maia Sharp.\n\nABOUT MAIA SHARP\nMaia Sharp has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, Keb’ Mo’ (including his recent single \"Junkyard Dog\" with Taj Mahal) and Trisha Yearwood (including her recent single “The Wall or the Way Over”) and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums; nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock and her duo project, Roscoe & Etta. Maia is also an adjunct professor at NYU and has been writing for Songwriting With: Soldiers for eight years. Her latest album Tomboy was released in September 2025.\nABOUT GARY BURR\nAward-winning songwriter Gary Burr has been responsible for some of the greatest pop and country songs of the last three decades. Born in Meriden, Connecticut, he fell in love with music when he went to the original Woodstock Festival, and decided to take a shower and then start a band. A broken leg placed him in a body cast for three months, so he took that opportunity to learn the guitar and take a crash course in songwriting from the albums he had next to his bed, Carole King, Pure Prairie League and, of course, The Beatles.\nAs his career progressed he ended up working with the very artists he was inspired by... as the lead singer in Pure Prairie League replacing Vince Gill, touring the world singing and playing with Carole King, and writing six albums with Ringo Starr.\nABOUT GEORGIA MIDDLEMAN\nGeorgia Middleman’s love affair with music is evident in every song she writes. Her songs blend passion and insight into the human condition with powerful melodies in a combination that hearkens to the timelessness of classic American popular music. One of Nashville’s most accomplished singer/songwriters, Georgia has had songs recorded by Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, Terri Clark, Joe Nichols, Maia Sharp and Sheila E., among many others. Her song “When The Right One Comes Along” was featured in ABC’s TV show “Nashville” and in 2010, Keith Urban took “I’m In,” which she co-wrote with Radney Foster, to the top of the country charts. Those who have seen Georgia live, though, can attest that there is real magic in her own renditions of her songs as she wraps one of music’s most expressive voices around lovingly crafted glimpses into life and love at their most compelling.",

Since its debut, the show has inspired 22 soundtracks, including a Christmas album, which collectively sold millions of album units and single-track downloads around the world. \'NASHVILLE\' was also critically lauded with multiple Emmy®, Golden Globe® and Critics Choice award nominations.\n \n\n\n\n\nCharles Esten played Deacon Claybourne, a soulful guitarist, songwriter, and love interest whose story anchored much of the show’s heart. Esten is an actor-musician and comedian, and his time on Nashville helped spark a full-fledged music career of his own — he continues to perform, write songs, and tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClare Bowen portrayed Scarlett O\'Connor, a poet-turned-singer and songwriter who worked at the Bluebird Cafe and rose through Nashville’s music world on the show. Since then, Bowen has continued her musical path, releasing solo and collaborative albums and remaining active musically beyond the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Jackson played Avery Barkley, a rebellious musician with a “bad-boy” edge who navigated the highs and lows of fame and relationships during the series. Jackson, also a musician, has kept a foot in both acting and music since Nashville ended, including recent film work and ongoing musical output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Palladio was cast as Gunnar Scott, a sensitive, lovelorn country-music singer whose journey spanned all six seasons of the show. Following Nashville, Palladio has balanced music and acting, appearing in several film and TV projects while continuing to perform, describing the show as a career-defining blend of his passions.",
