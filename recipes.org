* Asparagus Frittata with Basil, Shallots and Parmesan

** Ingredients:
- 1 pound thin asparagus
- 2 Tbls extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium shallots, minced (onions will do in a pinch!)
- 6 large eggs -- egg beaters work just fine!
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (I use Pecorino Romano)
- ¼ cup shredded fresh basil leaves (I use 1 tsp dried)
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

** Method:
1. Snap and discard tough asparagus ends. Slice the asparagus on the bias into 1-inch-long pieces. Steam the asparagus in a bamboo steamer (or boil in salt water for 1½ minutes), until almost tender.
2. Preheat the broiler. Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet with an oven proof handle. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Add the shallots and sauté over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook for 30 seconds. 
3. In a medium bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs, cheese, basil and salt and pepper. Add the egg mixture to the pan and stir gently with a fork to incorporate the vegetables. Cook over medium-low heat, occasionally sliding a spatula around the edges of the pan to loosen the frittata as it sets. Continue cooking until the frittata is set, except for the top, about 8 minutes.
4. Place the pan directly under the broiler and cook just until the top is golden brown and set, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not let the frittata burn.
5. Invert the frittata onto a large platter. (Optionally sprinkle with a little kosher salt.) Cut it into wedges and serve. The frittata may also be cooled to room temperature and then cut and served.

* Baron Bagels

** Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 5 cups bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt, plus more for boiling
- 1 tablespoon diastatic malt powder
- Â¼ cup poppy seeds, optional
- Â¼ cup sesame seeds, optional

** Method
1. Put the yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer. Add 1 2/3 cups lukewarm water and allow the yeast to activate, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt and malt powder and mix at low speed for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. Cover the dough and allow to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.
2. Punch the dough down and shape into a rough rectangle about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick, and about 2 times longer than it is wide. If you are having trouble forming the dough, stretch it, wait for the gluten to relax and reform.
3. Cut the dough into 10 pieces of about 3 ounces each. Roll each into an 8-inch-long snakelike shape, tapering the dough at each end. Circle the dough around your hand, pinching the ends together and rolling under your palm once or twice to seal. Put the bagels on a Silpat or other nonstick baking sheet on top of a jellyroll pan. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 10 hours, or up to 24 hours.
4. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. If you have a baking stone or brick you use for baking, put it on a rack near the bottom of the oven; it will retain heat and produce a crisper bagel. Bring a large pot of water to boil, throw a handful of salt into the boiling water and remove the bagels from the refrigerator.
5. Using your hands, carefully place just enough bagels into the pot to cover the surface of the water, making sure that there are no bagels resting on top of one another. Let them float on one side for about 30 seconds before flipping them to the other side for another 30 seconds or so. Remove the bagels and drain well on a cooling rack.
6. Pour poppy or sesame seeds into a bowl wider than the bagels. Working very quickly, remove the bagels one by one and dip them into the topping. Place them back on the Silpat-covered baking sheet, topping side down.
7. Bake on the second to highest shelf of the oven for about 7 minutes. Then flip the bagels and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

- Cook Time: 15 minutes

** Ingredients:
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar

2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
3. Mix thoroughly the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl with a whisk or spoon.
4. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the raisins. Using a large spoon, blend in buttermilk until a soft dough forms.
5. Place dough on a floured board and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into six squares, then cut each square again on the diagonal. Place triangles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.

 Buttermilk Syrup
* Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 tablespoon Light karo syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

* Method
1. In a large pot or saucepan over medium heat add the butter, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla and karo syrup. Heat until everything is well combined and bring to a boil.  

2. Quickly remove the pot from the heat and add the baking soda, place back over the heat, stirring constantly. The syrup will grow large and threaten to boil over which is why a large pot is essential. If it gets too close to the edge remove from the burner and continue stirring to bring it down. 

3. Stir for 30 seconds over the heat (I often just take mine off so I don't risk boiling over) and serve immediately.

3. the rosemary and thyme. Lower the heat and cook slowly, uncovered, until onions are golden, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. [Don't try to hurry the onions; they'll know this and won't caramelize! -jc]
4. Add the water, wine, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley and capers (if you have to!). Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and transfer to a food processor container fitted with a steel blade. Add the olives. Cover and process until everything is finely chopped.
5. Variation: Substitute water for the wine.

* Champ

** Ingredients:
- 2 lbs. potatoes, unpeeled
- 2/3 cup milk
- 4-5 scallions, finely chopped
- ¼-½ cup butter
- salt and pepper

** Method:
1. Champ, also known as cally, poundies and pandy, is one of the most famous ways of serving Ireland's best loved vegetable--the potato. Champ is the country's way of serving mashed potatoes.
2. Heat a pan of salted water and boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Drain and dry over low heat covered with a paper towel. Peel and mash well.
3. While the potatoes are cooking, put the milk and chopped scallions into a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer for a few minutes. Gradually beat the milk and onion mixture into the mashed potatoes to form a soft, but not sloppy, mixture. Beat in half the butter and searson with salt pepper. Divide among 4 warm plates or bowls. Make a well in the center of each serving, cut the remaining butter into 4 pieces, and put one piece in each of the hollows. Serve immediately.
4. Cook's notes:
5. Traditionally, champ would have been served as a main meal, with a glass of milk or buttermilk. Today, however, it is used to acocompany meats such as boiled ham and broiled sausages. Parsley, young nettle tops, peas and fava beans can be substituted for the scallions.
6. Serves 4.
7. Prep time: 5 minutes
8. Cooking time: 20-25 minutes

Made for 4th of July party [2016-07-03 Sun]. They were a big hit with the crowd, but I thought they were a lot like the stuff you get at Olive Garden.

* Chocolate Chip Cookies

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup unbleached flour (I use King Arthur – organic if I can find it)
- 1 cup King Arthur white or regular whole wheat flour
- ½ cup quick cooking oatmeal (uncooked) I use what I have on hand, not necessarily quick cooking.
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. coarse salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1 lb premium quality bittersweet chocolate (see note below) cut into medium-sized chunks.
- 2 cups walnuts, coarsely chopped (the Supreme Cookie Dude aka Pat, likes big chunks of nuts and lots of ‘em)

** Method:
1. About the chocolate: I do not use chocolate chips because IMHO the better the chocolate, the better the cookie.
2. If I can’t afford the really good stuff I don’t make these. I like to use Valhrona bittersweet chocolate that comes
3. in thin bars (not sure of the weight but the bars are around 6” by 3” and maybe ½” deep -- I use several) so that
4. the chocolate is sort of in layers in the cookie. Scharffen Berger, Green and Black’s dark baking, and Callebaut
5. all work well. The best buy is from Trader Joe’s though (sorry, Jen!!!) and it’s their 1 lb. Plus bars which are
6. actually made by Callebaut. I use either the 72% (especially if making these cookies for adults) or the Dark
7. Chocolate (which is closer to semi-sweet and better for kids). But they also have the best price around on
8. Valhrona too.
9. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream together
10. butter and sugars. Blend in vanilla and egg. Slowly add in the flour mixture until nearly combined. Add in
11. chocolate chips and nuts and stir by in by hand (this is normally Pat’s job). It may seem like the dough won’t
12. handle all the chocolate and nuts but it does. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto baking sheets (I use one of
13. those cool cookie scoops that has the releasing mechanism) – you can put them very close together. Refrigerate
14. for 24 hours or longer (or freeze) then I take out only what I need for one pan at a time and bake on sheets.
15. These are great to have in the freezer to bake at a moment’s notice – do not thaw or allow to come to room temp
16. before baking.
17. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or use silpat sheets and preheat over to 350o. Bake one sheet at a
18. time for 7 minutes, then turn sheets around 180o and bake for another 6 minutes until lightly browned. (Your
19. oven may run hotter or colder than mine but this it what works in mine). Remove pan from the oven but leave
20. cookies on the paper and slip the paper onto a wire rack to cool. Since there’s so much chocolate in these and
21. it's in big pieces, if you take the cookies off the paper the chocolate will drip while it’s still hot.

** Yield Makes 48 cookies.

* Chocolate Cream Pie
** Ingredients
*** Crust
- 181g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 46g vegetable shortening
- 57g (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter
- 28 to 57g ice water
*** Filling
- 28g unsalted butter
- 227g semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 131g granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 11g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for richer chocolate flavor
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 3 large egg yolks
- 227g heavy cream, divided
- 454g milk
*** Topping
- 227g heavy cream
- 28g confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
** Method
*** Crust
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, and salt.
2. Cut in the shortening until it's in lumps the size of small peas.
3. Dice the butter into 1/2" pieces, and cut into the mixture until you have flakes of butter the size of your fingernail.
4. Add the water, two tablespoons at a time, mixing with a fork as you sprinkle the water into the dough.
5. When the dough is moist enough to hold together when you squeeze it, transfer it to a piece of wax or parchment paper. It's ok if there are dry spots in the pile. Use a spray bottle of water to lightly spritz these places; that way you'll add just enough water to bring the dough together without adding too much or creating a wet spot.
6. Fold it over on itself three or four times to bring it together, then pat it into a disk 3/4" thick
7. Roll the disk on its edge, like a wheel, to smooth out the edges. This step will ensure your dough will roll out evenly, without a lot of cracks and splits at the edges later. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.
8. To blind bake the crust: Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" pie pan that's at least 2" deep. This will make serving the pie easier after it's finished.
9. Roll out the pastry for the pie to a 13" circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan, and trim the edges so they overlap the edge by an inch all the way around. Tuck the edges up and under, and flute them. Put the lined pie pan in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes.
10. Line the crust with foil or parchment paper, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crust for 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and gently remove foil or parchment with the weights or beans. Return the crust to the oven for 10 to 20 more minutes, until it's golden brown all over. If the edges of the crust start becoming too brown, cover them with a pie shield, or strips of aluminum foil. Remove the crust from the oven and cool completely.
*** Filling
1. Place the chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in a 2-quart mixing bowl; set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan away from heat, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa, espresso powder, and salt. Whisk in 1/4 cup of cold heavy cream until the mixture is smooth, with no lumps. Repeat with another 1/4 cup of the cream. Whisk in the egg yolks.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and gradually whisk in the remaining cream and milk.
4. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly as the mixture thickens; boil for 1 minute.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture over the reserved chocolate and butter.
6. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
7. (optionally) Pass the filling through a strainer into a bowl to remove any lumps.
8. Place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and chill thoroughly.
*** Topping
1. Place the heavy cream in a chilled mixing bowl.
2. Whip until the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl.
3. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until the cream holds a medium peak.
4. Assembly
5. Transfer the cooled filling to the cooled, baked pie crust. Level the top with the back of a spoon or an offset spatula.
6. Spoon or pipe the whipped cream on top.
7. Chill the pie until ready to serve. Note: If you're not planning on serving the entire pie at once, top individual slices with a dollop of whipped cream just before serving.
**** Variation: Meringue topping
***** Ingredients
- 3 large egg whites (reserved from filling)
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) sugar
- 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) water
***** Method
1. Place the egg whites in a clean bowl with clean beaters. Add the pinch of salt.
2. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.
3. Whip the egg whites until they turn white and the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl. Slowly add the hot sugar syrup, and continue beating until the whites make stiff peaks.
4. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
5. Pipe or spoon the meringue over the top of the filled, chilled pie, making sure you cover the filling completely.
6. Place the pie in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the meringue is golden brown. Remove from the oven and refrigerate until ready to serve

Made at T's request. Good pie, but the crust was a bit hard/tough. Overworked and over cooked? 
Pudding was good. I used well-ground coffee beans and didn't strain it.

* Crispy Red Potatoes with Warm Asian Slaw & Limey Sauce
** Overview
Welcome back to the Best Recipes of 2012! post-Thanksgiving edition. 4 days ago, most of us were no better than we should have been about the carbs, which is one of the reasons I saved this recipe till after the holiday.  The other is that itâ€™s the kind of recipe thereâ€™s never enough of, and I figured there was no point in ratcheting up the level of family tension any more than necessary.

The book: The Fresh & Green Table, by Susie Middleton (Chronicle Books, $24.95 hereâ€™s my complete review)

The recipe: Crispy Red Potato Patties with Asian Slaw and Limey Sauce

Why I tried it: I have yet to meet anyone who can resist a crisp potato, and Iâ€™ve long loved the way that roasting a potato gets you a whole lot of crunch with a minimum of oil.  Could there be another way to roast potatoes, other than the good olâ€™ roasty chunks I learned to make from my trusty One Potato Two Potato?  The lime-and-gingery slaw sounded conventional, but it also seemed like a virtuous foil for the potatoes.

Why I loved it: First of all, the squashed potatoes have all kinds of surface area for crisping up, which they do with a vengeance.  Then itâ€™s lime, lime, lime.  Tart lime and zest juicing up the soft mayo, lime brightening the fine shreds of cabbage in the slaw, all of it balanced with curve-filling sweetness just where it needs it.  The slaw is great, and it makes you feel good about yourself. But it was the crispy little bits of potato, perfect for dipping in limey sauce, that we were all fighting over in the end.  (If you feel like saving yourself some trouble and just making the potatoes and sauce and skipping the slaw, I assure you the recipe will still rock your socks off, and no one will know.)

** Time
- Estimated preparation time: 90 minutes, including a bit of downtime during which you can make the sauce and the slaw.

** Crispy Red Potatoes

*** Ingredients:
- 16 baby red potatoes of uniform size (about 1Â½ oz each)
- kosher salt
- Â½ cup canola oil

*** Method:
1. To cook the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 475Â°F. Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a piece of parchment. Put a double layer of dish towels on a large cutting board or your counter. Arrange the potatoes (preferably in a single layer) in a large Dutch oven and add enough water to cover them by at least 1 1/2 inches. Add 2 tsp salt, cover loosely, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender all the way through but not falling apart (check with a paring knife), 18 to 20 minutes.

2. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer each potato to the dish towels, not touching, and let cool for a few minutes. Using another folded dish towel, gently press down on each potato to flatten it into a patty about 1/2 inch thick (or up to 3/4 inch). The patties donâ€™t have to be perfectly even, and a few pieces of potato may break off. (No matter; you can still roast them.) Let the patties cool for a few minutes more, transfer them to the baking sheet, and let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Or, at this point, you can hold the potatoes in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature before roasting.)

3. Sprinkle the potatoes with 1/4 tsp salt and pour the canola oil over them. Care fully flip the potatoes over and season again with a scant 1/2 tsp salt. Rub with some of the oil, making sure that the potatoes are well coated on all sides. Roast, carefully turning once with a spatula halfway through cooking, until they turn a deep orange brown (a little darker and crisper around the edges), 28 to 30 minutes.



** The limey sauce:


*** Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- Â½ tsp finely grated lime zest
- Â½ tsp finely minced garlic
- kosher salt



*** Method:
1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until well combined. Let sit for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. Refrigerate if making ahead.


** The Asian slaw:
- 1Â½ cups very thinly sliced napa or savoy cabbage (pale inner leaves only)
- 1 cup very thinly sliced red cabbage
- 1 cup (packed) baby spinach leaves
- kosher salt
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1Â½ tsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1Â½ tsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp canola oil, plus 2 tsp
- Â½ medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp minced peeled fresh ginger
- Â½ tsp minced garlic
- 2 tbsp thinly sliced scallions (white and green parts)

*** Method:
1. To make the slaw: In a large heatproof mixing bowl, combine the napa cabbage, red cabbage, and spinach. Sprinkle the greens with 1/4 tSp salt. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, lime juice, and brown sugar. In a medium heavy nonstick skillet, heat the 2 tsp canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the red onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the onion is wilted and just starting to brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the onion to the bowl of greens and let the skillet cool for a few seconds off the heat.

2. Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the pan to the heat, and add the remaining 1 tbsp canola oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the vinegar mixture to the pan (scrape out all the brown sugar with a small spatula), stir vigorously to warm it through, and immediately remove the pan from the heat. Stir and scrape the hot dressing over the greens, tossing the greens with tongs as you pour. Toss thoroughly to coat well and to soften and wilt the greens just a bit. (The cabbage will still be crunchy.) Taste and add more salt (if desired).

3. Arrange four dinner plates on your counter. On one side of each plate arrange four potato patties, slightly overlapping. On the other side of eacplate, mound a quarter of the slaw. Spoon some of the limey sauce over the potatoes (down the middle of the rowof potatoes), and top each serving with the scallions. Serve right away.

* Double Lemon-Poppy Seed Bundt Cake
Serves: 16

** Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup poppy seeds
- 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk or equivalent buttermilk powder
- 1/4 cup canola oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon water

** Method:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch (12-cup) Bundt pan, preferably nonstick, with cooking spray and dust with flour (or use cooking spray with flour).
2. Toast poppy seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
3. Whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and the poppy seeds in a medium bowl. Combine buttermilk, oil, vanilla, lemon zest and lemon juice in a glass measuring cup.
4. Beat eggs, egg whites and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until thickened and pale, about 5 minutes.
5. Fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture with a rubber spatula, a third at a time, alternating with 2 additions of the buttermilk mixture. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly.
6. Bake the cake until the top springs back when touched lightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Loosen the edges and turn the cake out onto the rack.
7. Meanwhile, prepare glaze: Sift 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar into a small bowl; mix with lemon juice and water to create a thin glaze. Poke 1-inch-deep holes all over the cake with a skewer. Coat the warm cake with the glaze using a pastry brush. Let cool completely. To serve, set the cake on a serving plate and dust with confectioners' sugar.

* Dried Mushroom Soup with Barley

** Ingredients:
- ½ ounce dried mushrooms, such as porcini, shiitake, chanterelle and/or morel -- about 2/3 cup
- 6 cups boiling water
- 1 tsp canola or other vegetable oil
- 2 cups chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 1 cup carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms (about 10 oz.)
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- pinch dried thyme
- ¼ tsp ground black pepper
- ½ cup raw pearl barley
- ¼ cup dry shery or 2 tsp honey
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

** Method:
1. In a saucepan, cover the dried mushrooms with 6 cups boiling water. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside for at least 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, warm the oil in a soup pot on low heat. Add the onions and garlic, cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the celery and carrots and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the fresh mushrooms, increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring continuously, for about 3 minutes, until the mushrooms begin to release their jucies. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3. Drain the dried mushrooms, reserving the mushroom stock. Cut off and discard any tough stems, then rinse and chop the mushrooms. Strain the stock through a sieve or-- if dirt or sand is evident-- through a paper coffee filter. Add enough water to the stock to make 7 cups of liquid. 
4. Add the chopped dried mushrooms, mushroom stock, soy sauce, thyme, pepper, barley and optional sherry or honey to the pot of sautéed vegetables. Bring to a boil and then cover; reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
5. When ready to serve, add salt and pepper to taste. The soup should be brothy, so if it has cooked down and become thick, add a bit more water.

* Flaky Pie Crust
From the book How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman

** Ingredients:
- For any single-crust pie, 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Double the recipe for a two-crust pie.
- 1? cups (about 5 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting work surface
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 8 Tbsp. (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into about 8 pieces
- About 3 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed

** Method:
1. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the container of a food processor; pulse once or twice. Add the butter and turn on the machine; process until the butter and flour are blended and the mixture looks like cornmeal, about 10 seconds.
2. Place the mixture in a bowl and sprinkle 3 tablespoons of water over it. Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to gradually gather the mixture into a ball; if the mixture seems dry, add another ½ tablespoon ice water. When you can make the mixture into a ball with your hands, do so. Wrap in plastic wrap, flatten into a small disk, and freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate for 30 minutes); this will ease rolling. (You can also refrigerate the dough for a day or two, or freeze it almost indefinitely.)
3. You can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap, usually quite successfully; sprinkle both sides of it with a little more flour, then proceed. Or sprinkle a countertop or large board with flour. Unwrap the dough and place it on the work surface; sprinkle its top with flour. If the dough is hard, let it rest for a few minutes; it should give a little when you press your fingers into it.
4. Roll with light pressure, from the center out. (If the dough seems very sticky at first, add flour liberally; but if it becomes sticky only after you roll it for a few minutes, return it to the refrigerator for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Continue to roll, adding small amounts of flour as necessary, rotating the dough occasionally, and turning it over once or twice during the process. (Use ragged edges of dough to repair any tears, adding a drop of water while you press the patch into place.) When the dough is about 10 inches in diameter (it will be less than ¼-inch thick), place your pie plate upside down over it to check the size.
5. Move the dough into the pie plate by draping it over the rolling pin or by folding it into quarters, then moving it into the plate and unfolding it. When the dough is in the plate, press it firmly into the bottom, sides, and junction of bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough to about ½ inch all around, then tuck it under itself around the edge of the plate. Decorate the edges with a fork or your fingers. Freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate it for 30 minutes).
6. When you're ready to bake, prick it all over with a fork.

* Fruit and Nut Muffins
By Kim Carlson, from the Culinate Kitchen collection

Although I used to be a fan of super-sweet and cakey muffins, that's
no longer the case. But I still love the little package that a muffin
represents-- it's an easy snack.

I came up with this recipe, and although it contains only a relatively
little sugar, the fruit adds plenty of sweetness.

I hope you'll experiment with the amount of sugar you like.

Serve these muffins with butter and honey -- or not.


** Ingredients:
- 1 	cup whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- Â¼ 	cup sugar (or less; see Note)
- 1 	tsp. baking powder
- Â½ 	tsp. baking soda
- Â½ 	tsp. salt
- 2 	large eggs
- Â½ 	cup low-fat buttermilk
- Â¼ 	cup canola oil
- 1 	cup ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 	cup frozen blueberries
- Â½ 	cup chopped and toasted nuts, such as hazelnuts (optional)

** Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-muffin pan with paper
   baking cups.
2. Combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in
   a large mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and oil in a 4-cup glass
   measuring cup with a pour spout or a medium bowl. Stir in the
   mashed bananas.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a
   rubber spatula, stir just until blended. Fold in the blueberries
   and nuts.
5. Fill the muffin cups Â¾ full (add more batter to each cup if you
   have extra). Bake for 20 minutes, then check to see if the muffins
   are browning. If they need more time, bake 5 minutes longer.
6. Cool for 10 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature.

** Yield: 	12 muffins

** Credits:
- I've made these muffins with just two tablespoons of sugar and
  without any sugar at all. Both options are good.

   be well browned. 
8. Remove from oven and transfer to wire rack.  Cut tiny slit in side of each puff to allow steam to
   escape. 
9. These are best eaten the day they are baked.  You can freeze them on the baking sheet before
   cooking (add 10 minutes to cooking time) or heat them briefly to crisp them up again if you make
   them the previous day.

* Lemon Cornmeal Cake with Lemon Glaze and Crushed-Blueberry Sauce Glaze:

** Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups (packed) powdered sugar, sifted
- 2 tablespoons (or more) fresh lemon Juice
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon peel
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- Crushed-Blueberry Sauce

** Method:

1) For glaze: Combine powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in small bowl. Stir with spoon until smooth and paste-like, adding more lemon juice by 1/2 teaspoonfuls if glaze is too thick to spread. Set aside.

2) For cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides; line bottom with parchment. Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, lemon peel, and vanilla in small bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture and melted butter into flour mixture. Using rubber spatula, gently fold liquids into flour mixture until just blended (do not stir). Scrape batter into pan; spread evenly.
3) Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean and cake pulls away from sides of pan, about 30 minutes.
4) Immediately run knife around sides of cake. Place rack atop cake in pan. Using oven mitts, hold pan and rack firmly together and invert cake onto rack. Remove pan from cake. Place another rack on bottom of cake; invert 1 more time so that cake is top side up. Stir glaze until blended. While cake is still very hot, drop glaze by tablespoonfuls onto cake; spread to within 1/2 inch of edge (some glaze may drip down sides of cake). Cool completely. Serve with Crushed-Blueberry Sauce.

* Pie Crust (Classic)

** Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 - ¾ cup solid veg. shortening
- 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water

** Method:
1. Combine the flour and salt in a food processor. Add the shortening; pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2. With the machine running,trickle in 4 tablespoons of ice water through the feed tube, until the dough just gathers together. (If the dough seems dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more of ice water, ½ teaspoon at a time.)
3. Divide the dough in half, forming each half into a thick disk. Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill.
4. Remove half the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. (Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky.) With the help of a spatula, gently transfer the dough to a pie plate, pressing it lightly into the plate to fit. If the dough should tear, just press it together gently. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. If making a single-crust pie, turn the edge under and flute it decoratively.
5. Repeat for a top crust or for another bottom crust. The diameter for a top crust should be one inch larger than for the pie.
6. Follow the individual pie recipes for filling and baking.

* New York Variation Pizza Dough

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 pkg dry yeast
- 3 ¼ cups unbleached flour
- ½ tsp salt
- Soften yeast in water. Add salt then start adding flour until a wet dough forms. Knead briefly, just to form a consistent dough. Place ball of dough in a large plastic Ziploc bag (or large bowl) that has been coated with olive oil. Place in refrigerator for 4-5 hours. About the time you turn the oven on to pre-heat, pull dough out of refrigerator. Punch down and then let rest for 10 minutes. Divide ball in half and coat well with flour. Start patting each ball of dough out into a circle, the thinner the better, letting rest if it won't spread out.
- Place an oven rack at the very lowest position – remove other racks and set aside. Place baking tiles or pizza stone on the rack and preheat the oven to 500 F for an hour or so. Make sure stone is in the oven from the beginning otherwise the high heat might crack it.
- New York Style Tomato Sauce
- 1 can (28 ounces) Italian plum tomatoes - buy the best you can find
- 2 tbl. tomato paste
- 1 or 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

** Method:
1. Crush the tomatoes with your hands or a fork and place in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until thick and flavorful, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat. (This may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen up to 4 months)
2. To bake: Turn the smoke alarm off. Cover pizza peel with coarse corn meal. Place one flattened piece of the dough onto the peel, spread with olive oil, cover with a thick layer of tomato sauce then add toppings. Sprinkle on a thick layer of parmesan cheese then drizzle with olive oil. Slide pizza onto the hot stone and bake 10 to 15 minutes until the top of the pie is beginning to brown. Remove pizza from oven and place on a cutting board. Let sit for a few minutes then slice and eat while hot.

* Refried Bean, Zucchini and Corn Gratin
** Ingredients:
*** for the beans
- 3 cups simmered black beans or pinto beans, with liquid (see recipe)
- 2 tablespoons grapeseed or sunflower oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground
- 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon mild or hot chili powder (more to taste)

*** for the squash:
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- Â½ cup minced onion
- Salt to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Â½ pounds zucchini or mixed zucchini and yellow squash, sliced about 1/4 inch thick
- Â½ to 1 teaspoon oregano, preferably Mexican oregano, to taste

*** for the corn
- 2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 1 Â¼ cups milk
- 1 serrano chile, minced
- Â¼ cup cornmeal or polenta
- Salt to taste
- Â½ cup grated asadero, Monterey Jack or pecorino
- Â¼ cup crumbled queso cotijo, queso fresco, or feta
- 1 tablespoon butter or extra virgin olive oil


** Method:
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Oil or butter a 2-quart baking dish or gratin dish.

2. Refry beans: Drain off about 1/2 cup of liquid from beans, retaining it in a separate bowl to use later for moistening beans, should they dry out. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan and add ground cumin and chili. Cook, stirring over medium heat, for about a minute, until the spices begin to sizzle and cook. Add beans and optional chipotle. Fry beans, stirring and mashing with the back of a spoon, until they thicken and form a thin crust on the bottom of the pan. Stir up crust and mix into the beans. Cook until beans are thick but not dry, about 10 minutes. Add liquid you saved from the beans if they seem too dry. Taste refried beans and adjust salt (they probably wonâ€™t need any as the broth reduces when you refry them). Spread in an even layer in the baking dish. (Note: If you use canned beans, do not drain. The frying process will go more quickly.)

3. Clean and dry skillet. Heat over medium heat and add olive oil. Add onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add squash, oregano, salt and pepper, and turn up heat slightly. Cook, stirring often or tossing in pan, until squash is translucent and tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Spread in an even layer over the beans.

4. Combine corn and milk in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer 5 minutes, until corn is just tender. Stir in cornmeal and minced serrano, add salt to taste, and continue to simmer until mixture is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in grated cheese. Remove from heat and spread in an even layer over squash. Sprinkle crumbled cheese over top. Dot with butter or drizzle on oil.

5. Place in oven and bake 25 minutes, until bubbly and crumbled cheese is lightly browned. Serve hot or warm.

*** Tip
Advance preparation: The refried beans will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator, but you will need to moisten them before you assemble the gratin.

[2016-07-13 Wed] TC made for JC and Doris; yum!

* Rustic Bread
Makes 2 large loaves

** Ingredients:

*** Grains:
- 1/2 cup wheat berries or cracked wheat (optional)
- Preferment:
- >12.5 oz. water (1 1/2 cups)
- 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 lb. bread flour (3 1/2 cups)
- 1/2 tablespoon salt

*** Final dough:
- 12.5 oz. water (1 1/2 cups)
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 8 oz. bread flour (2  cups)
- 8 oz. whole wheat or rye flour or a mixture of them (around 2 cups)
- 1/4 cup or so flax meal (optional) 
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- all of the preferment 

** Method:
1. If using grains, soak in water, enough to cover, over night.
2. Put the yeast in the water and stir. Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl and pour in the yeasted water. Mix until the flour is hydrated, adding more water if necessary. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave the pre-ferment out at room temperature overnight (up to 16 hours... if you need more time before baking put it in the refrigerator).
3. To make the final dough, combine all of the ingredients except the pre-ferment in a mixing bowl. Chop the pre-ferment up into small pieces and mix or knead it into the final dough until they are thoroughly combined. This is quite difficult to do by hand: Hamelman assumes the baker has a mixer and can mix it for 5 minutes by machine. I mix and knead my dough by hand for about 10 minutes. At the end of that time the new and old dough aren't perfectly combined-- you can still see a few streaks of the lighter colored pre-ferment in it-- but they are sufficiently combined that loaves bake evenly.
4. Place the dough back in a greased bowl and ferment for 2 1/2 hours, punching down or folding the dough twice during that time.
5. (Folding the dough consists of taking the dough out of the bowl, spreading it out a little on a clean surface, folding it in thirds like a letter, rotating it 90 degrees and folding it up again, and then returning the dough to the bowl and covering it again. Like punching down, folding degases the dough some, but it also encourages gluten development. More on this topic in a future post.)
6. At the end of the fermentation, divide the dough into two pieces and preshape each into a ball. Cover with a clean towel and let each rest for 5 to 10 minutes before shaping into the final shape. Once shaped, cover the loaves with a clean towel and set aside for a final rise, approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
7. Halfway though the final rise, begin preheating the oven to 450 degrees. If you are using a baking stone, preheat it as well. 8. Right before placing it in the oven, score the loaves. Place them in the oven and use whatever technique you use to create stream in the oven (squirt bottle, skillet full of hot water, etc) to encourage proper crust development.
9. After 20 minutes of baking, rotate the loaves 180 degrees so that they'll bake evenly. Bake until an instant read thermometer reads around 200 degrees, which took approximately 35 minutes for my batard ("football") shaped loaves.

* Soup of Bitter Greens with Cheese Dumplings

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup parmesean cheese
- 1 cup pecorino romano cheese
- ¾ cup fine dry bread crumbs
- 1 Tblsp parsley
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 Tblsp olive oil

* Southwestern Quiche With Potato Crust 

** Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1.5 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 1/2 medium red bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels, thawed if frozen
- 2 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
- 3/4 cup shredded or crumbled Cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup low-fat milk
- 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, w/ 2 tsp. sauce reserved

** Method:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat the pie dish with cooking spray. Whisk together 1 egg and 1/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Stir in shredded hash browns. Press the potato mixture into the bottom and sides of the pie dish to form crust. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
2. Sprinkle the bell pepper, corn, green onions, cilantro, and cheese over the potato crust.
3. In a blender, mix together the remaining eggs, milk, 3/4 tsp. salt, chiles and adobo sauce. Pour mixture over vegetables in pie dish. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
4. Serves 6.
5. I served the quiche topped with avocado slices and good store-bought salsa (I had Mrs. Renfro’s Black Bean Salsa on hand). It was quite tasty, and everyone wanted seconds. I’ll make this again, but I think next time I’ll serve it with some black beans or a salad on the side, to add some fiber, and maybe add a third chipotle pepper (love the smokey flavor they add).

* Spoon Cookies
From Gourmet, Dec. 2005
Makes 25-30 sandwich cookies

** Ingredients:
- 2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- ¾ cup sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/8 tsp salt, slightly rounded
- ½ cup fruit preserves (your choice – cherry and strawberry are good)

** Method:
1. Fill kitchen sink with about 2 inches of cold water. Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter turns golden with a nutlike fragrance and flecks on bottom of pan turn a rich caramel brown, 10 to 12 minutes. (Butter will initially form, then dissipate. A thicker form will appear and cover the surface just before butter begins to brown; stir more frequently toward end of cooking.) Place pan in sink to stop cooking, then cool, stirring frequently, until butter starts to look opaque, about 4 minutes. Remove pan from sink and stir in sugar and vanilla.
2. Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda and stir into butter mixture until a dough forms. Shape into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and let stand at cool room temperature 1 to 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop).
3. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325F. 
4. Press a piece of dough into bowl of teaspoon (table type teaspoon, not one for measuring), flattening top, then slide out and place, flat side down, on an ungreased baking sheet. (Dough will feel crumbly, but will become cohesive when pressed.) Continue forming cookies and arranging on sheet. Bake cookies until just pale golden, 8 to 15 minutes. Cool cookies on sheet on a rack 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Cookies are very delicate when hot.
5. While cookies cool, heat preserves in a small saucepan over low heat until just runny, then pour through a sieve into a small bowl, pressing hard on solids, and cool completely. Spread the flat side of a cookie with a thin layer of preserves. Sandwich with flat side of another cookie. Continue with remaining cookies and preserves, then let stand until set, about 45 minutes. Transfer cookies to an airtight contain and (this is the hard part) WAIT 2 DAYS BEFORE EATING.
6. Dough can be made 12 hours before baking and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature to soften slightly before forming cookies, about 30 minutes. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 2 weeks.

* Stuffed French Toast

** Ingredients:

- 8 (1-inch thick) slices bread (See Kellyâ€™s Note)
- 4 ounces (1/2 of an 8-oz. package) cream cheese, at room temp
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 1 1/2 cups diced strawberries, divided

- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 4 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon sugar

- Unsalted butter, for cooking
- Maple syrup, for serving

** Method:
1. Cut a wide pocket into each slice of bread without cutting all the way through the bread.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheese, vanilla extract, lemon juice, lemon zest and 1/2 cup diced strawberries until well combined, about 2 minutes.

3. Slather a portion of the cream cheese mixture inside each bread pocket and press each bread pocket closed.

4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, cinnamon and sugar.

5. Place a large pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted, dip each stuffed slice of toast into the egg mixture on all sides and shake off any excess. Place the bread immediately into the pan and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Flip once and continue cooking until golden, about 2 minutes. Repeat the coating the cooking process with the remaining slices of bread. (Do not overcrowd the pan.)

6. Serve the French toast immediately topped with maple syrup and the remaining diced strawberries.

*** Kellyâ€™s Note:
Any variety of bread will work in this recipe. A few of my favorites include a loaf of sourdough, a French baguette or (extra-thick) Texas toast. Use whatever type of bread you prefer, however stale bread works best for French Toast, as it absorbs the most liquid.
*** My Notes:
- [2016-07-17 Sun] Made for Colwills, Doris and TC. Good, but /way/ too lemony... even though I used about half the zest and none of the lemon juice.

* Pizza

** Master Dough with Starter
Makes about 29 ounces (820 grams) dough, enough for 2 pizzas This is what Iâ€™d call the quintessential American pizza dough, inspired by New Yorkâ€“style pizza: medium thin, satisfyingly chewy, and the ideal companion to mozzarella, tomato sauce, and the pizza toppings Americans love best, from pepperoni and sausage to olives, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Itâ€™s the dough I teach first to new students, and the one I recommend experimenting with because itâ€™s so versatile and user-friendly.

*** Ingredients:
- 2.2 grams (3/4 teaspoon) active dry yeast
- 70 grams (1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon) warm water (80Â°F to 85Â°F)
- 453 grams flour (3-1/2 cups) with 13 to 14 percent protein, preferably All Trumps, Pendleton Flour Mills Power, Giustoâ€™s High Performer, King Arthur Sir Lancelot Unbleached Hi-Gluten, or Tonyâ€™s California Artisan Flour
- 10 grams (1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon) diastatic malt
- 210 grams (3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ice water, plus more as needed
- 90 grams Poolish (see sidebar) or Tiga (see sidebar)
- 10 grams (2 teaspoons) fine sea salt
- 5 grams (1 teaspoon) extra virgin
- olive oil

*** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the warm water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The yeast should dissolve in the water and the mixture should foam. If it doesnâ€™t and the yeast granules float, the yeast is â€œdeadâ€ and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Combine the flour and malt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.

3. With the mixer running on the lowest speed, pour in most of the icewater, reserving about 2 tablespoons, followed by the yeast-water mixture. Pour the reserved water into the yeast bowl, swirl it around to dislodge any bits of yeast stuck to the bowl, and add to the mixer. Mix for about 15 seconds, stop the mixer, and add the poolish or tiga.

4. Continue to mix the dough at the lowest speed for about 1 minute, until most of the dough comes together around the hook. Stop the mixer. Use your fingers to pull away any dough clinging to the hook, and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a bowl scraper or rubber spatula. Check the bottom of the bowl for any unincorporated flour. Turn the dough over and press it into the bottom of the bowl to pick up any stray pieces. If the dough isnâ€™t holding together, add small amounts of water (about 1/2 teaspoon to start) and mix until the dough is no longer dry and holds together.

5. Add the salt and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute to combine.

6. Stop the mixer, pull the dough off the hook, and add the oil. Mix the dough for 1 to 2 minutes, stopping the mixer from time to time to pull the dough off the hook and scrape down the sides of the bowl, until all of the oil is absorbed. The dough wonâ€™t look completely smooth.

7. Use a bowl scraper to transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface, then knead it for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp dish towel and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Use the dough cutter to loosen the dough and to cut it in half.  Weigh the dough, adjusting the quantity as necessary to give you two 13-ounce pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Any remaining dough can be discarded.

8. Form the dough into balls. Set the balls on a half sheet pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Or, if you will be baking the balls on different days, place each ball on a quarter sheet pan. Wrap the pan(s) airtight with a double layer of plastic wrap, sealing the wrap well under the pan(s). Put the pan(s) in a level spot in the refrigerator and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.


** TIGA and POOLISH Starters
Here are the two starters I use most frequently in this book and in my restaurants. Tiga is my slightly more hydrated version of a classic biga starter, which is usually between 50 and 60 percent water. This â€œTonyâ€™s biga,â€ which I call â€œTiga,â€ has 70 percent hydration.

My poolish follows the traditional proportions of equal parts water and flour, so its hydration is much higher at 100 percent. In general, unless I specify otherwise, use the same flour in your starter that you will be using in your dough. I always make starters with cold water to slow down the fermentation process for greater flavor complexity. Itâ€™s helpful to use a clear glass bowl so you can see how well your starter is fermenting.

*** TIGA
Makes 90 grams

**** Ingredients:
- 0.14 gram (one-third of 1/8 teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.42 gram
  fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 39 grams (2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons) cold tap water
- 55 grams (1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe

**** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesnâ€™t and the yeast granules float, the yeast is â€œdeadâ€ and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine. The consistency will be quite thick.

3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.

4. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours. Bring it to cool room temperature before using.

* Ultimate Veggie Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. Sprouted garbanzos are becoming more readily available, but if you can't find them, canned or cooked garbanzos (chickpeas) will work great. Sprouting boosts their already fantastic nutritional value even more...

** Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 cups sprouted garbanzo beans (chickpeas) OR canned garbanzos, drained and rinsed
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 onion, chopped
- Grated zest of one large lemon
- 1 cup micro sprouts, chopped (try brocolli, onion, or alfalfa sprouts - optional)
- 1 cup toasted (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
Method:
1. If you are using sprouted garbanzos, steam them until just tender, about 10 minutes. Most of you will be using canned beans, so jump right in and combine the garbanzos, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a very thick, slightly chunky hummus. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the cilantro, onion, zest, and sprouts. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.
3. Makes 12 mini burgers.

* Vegetarian Lentil Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. I use black lentils in this recipe, some of the other types of lentils are too mushy when cooked - so I'd stick with the black lentils. Feel free to spice up the batter by experimenting with your favorite seasonings.

** Ingredients:
- 3 cups cooked black lentils
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup toasted fine (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
** Method:
1. Combine the lentils, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a runny yet textured hummus - it's o.k. if many of the lentils remain whole (see photo). Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the onion. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a very moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.
3. Makes 12 mini burgers.

Combine ¼ cup brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over dough. Beginning with a long side, roll up jelly-roll fashion; pich seam to seal (do not seal ends of rolls). Cut roll into 24 (1-inch) slices, using string or dental floss. Arrange 12 slices, cut sides up in each pan. Cover with plastic wrap coated with cooking spray, and let rise in refrigerator 8 to 24 hours or until doubled in size.
