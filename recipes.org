** Crusty European-Style Hard Rolls
These rolls have a delicious crackly/crunchy crust, partly the result of allowing them to proof in the refrigerator, partly from an egg white wash applied just prior to baking. Their texture is light and airy, rather than substantial, which makes them a wonderful mini-sandwich roll. Make them slightly larger, and they're perfect for hamburgers or grilled sausage. Or serve them at breakfast, with butter and preserves, as they do in Europe. 
Notice that this recipe includes just over 1/4 teaspoon yeast. Why so little? Because of the extra-long fermentation, key to developing the rolls' flavor. As the dough rests, the yeast will continue to multiply; thus there's no need to "front-load" with lots of yeast initially.
Note: These take roughly a whole day, including *9 hours* on "day of" to make!
*** Ingredients
**** Starter
- 113g cool water
- 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast
**** Dough
- all of the starter
- 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 227g lukewarm water
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
**** Egg wash
- 1 large egg white mixed with 1-2 tablespoon cool water
*** Method
1. To make the starter: Mix the starter ingredients together until smooth, cover, and let rest at room temperature overnight.
2. Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them together - by hand, mixer or bread machine - until you've made a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. It may also stick to the bowl just the tiniest bit.
3. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 3 hours, gently deflating it and turning it over after 1 hour, and again after 2 hours.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide it into 12 pieces, shape the pieces into balls, and firm them up by rolling them under your lightly cupped fingers.
5. Place the rolls on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover them, and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until they're puffy, though not doubled in size. They'll flatten out a bit as they rise; that's OK.
6. Cover the rolls, and refrigerate them for 2 to 3 hours. Towards the end of the rolls' chill, preheat the oven to 425 degreesF.
7. Whisk together the egg white and water until frothy. Remove the rolls from the refrigerator, and brush them with the wash; you won't use it all up. Again, don't be discouraged if the rolls seem a bit flat; they'll pick up when the hit the oven's heat.
8. Slash a 1/4" deep cut across the top of each roll. Immediately put the rolls into the oven.
9. Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, until they're a deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack. Or, for best crunch, open the oven door, and allow the rolls to cool in the turned-off, open-door oven.
*** Yield
- 12 small rolls
*** Credits
For larger rolls, divide the dough into 8 pieces, rather than 12. Bake for a minute or two longer.

- 1 3/4-2 cups buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon butter
*** Method
1. Sift the flour and baking soda into a large mixing bowl, then stir in th esalt, sugar, and fruit. Make a well in the ceter and pour in almost all the buttermilk.  Stir with a broad-bladed knife or wooden spoon to form a loose dough, adding the rest of the milk if necessary.
2. Use the butter to grease an 8-inch round cake pan, approximately 3 inches deep. Place the dough in the pan, leaving the surface rough. Sprinkle with a little flour, set the pan on a baking sheet, and bake in a preheated oven for 30 minutes.
3. Reduce the temperature and cook for a further 30 minutes until the bread is golden-brown and crisp to the touch. A skewer inserted in the center should come out clean.  Remove from the cake pan and wrap in a clean cloth. When col, cut in slices and serve buttered.
4. makes 1 round loaf
5. Prep time: 10-15 minutes
6. Cooking time: 1-1 1/4 hours
7. Oven temperature: 400 degrees F for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 300 degrees F for a further 30-40 minutes.

** Easy Hot Cross Buns
*** Times
- PREP:  25 mins. to 35 mins.
- BAKE:  20 mins. to 20 mins.
- TOTAL:  2 hrs 45 mins. to 3 hrs 15 mins.
- YIELD: 12 to 14 buns
This soft dough is easily shaped, and makes tender, aromatic buns, ready for an icing cross on top.
*** Ingredients
**** Buns:
- 1/4 cup (57g) apple juice or rum
- 1/2 cup (78g) mixed dried fruit
- 1/2 cup (78g) raisins or dried currants
- 1.25 cup (283g) milk, room temperature
- 2 large eggs, plus 1 egg yolk (save the white for the topping)
- 6 tablespoons (85g) butter, room temperature
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1/4 cup (53g) light brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves or allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 4.5 cups (539g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
**** Topping:
- 1 large egg white, reserved from above
- t Tablespoon (14g) milk
**** Icing:
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons (128g) confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- pinch of salt
- 4 teaspoons milk, or enough to make a thick, pipeable icing
*** Method
1. Lightly grease a 10" square pan or 9" x 13" pan.
2. Mix the rum or apple juice with the dried fruit and raisins, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave briefly, just till the fruit and liquid are very warm, and the plastic starts to "shrink wrap" itself over the top of the bowl. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Note: If you worry about using plastic wrap in your microwave, simply cover the bowl with a glass lid.
3. When the fruit is cool, mix together all of the dough ingredients (including the eggs and the egg yolk from the separated egg); hold out the fruit for the time being. Knead the mixture, using an electric mixer or bread machine, until the dough is soft and elastic. Mix in the fruit and any liquid not absorbed.
4. Let the dough rise for 1 hour, covered. It should become puffy, though may not double in bulk.
5. Divide the dough into billiard ball-sized pieces, about 3 3/4 ounces each. A heaped muffin scoop (about 1/3 cup) makes about the right portion. You'll make 12 to 14 buns. Use your greased hands to round them into balls. Arrange them in the prepared pan.
6. Cover the pan, and let the buns rise for 1 hour, or until they've puffed up and are touching one another. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375 degreesF.
7. Whisk together the reserved egg white and milk, and brush it over the buns.
8. Bake the buns for 20 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove from the oven, carefully turn the buns out of the pan (they should come out in one large piece), and transfer them to a rack to cool.
9. Mix together the icing ingredients, and when the buns are completely cool, pipe it in a cross shape atop each bun.
**** Tips from our bakers
Want to make these buns a day or so ahead of time? Try the *tangzhong technique*, a Japanese method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast rolls. 
- Begin by measuring out the flour and milk you'll be using in the recipe. 
- Now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and 1/2 cup of the measured milk; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat.
- Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it thickens and forms a thick slurry; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes. 
- Transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl, let it cool to lukewarm, then combine it with the remaining flour, milk, and other dough ingredients. 
- Proceed with the recipe as directed. 
- Well-wrapped and stored at room temperature, your finished hot cross buns should stay soft and fresh for several days.

** Italian Country Bread
Makes 2 large loaves
*** Description
This is a classic rustic bread, sometimes known as /pane bianco/ or /pane casalinga/, made into one large round and baked on a hot stone to produce a crusty, domed outer crust and a moist interior full of irregular holes. It is perfect with food and wonderful to have on hand to serve with wines before a meal. Note that the technique varies from traditional American bread receipes: cool liquid, a small amount of yeast, an initial rising with a sponge, along resting time to develop taste, moist dough and a high baking temperature. It appeals to the purist since nothing is added to detract from the developed fragrance and flavor of the grain. Note that unbleached all-purpose flour is used, as it has a protein content similar to that of 00 grade flour in Italy (12 percent) and creates a fine, white loaf.
*** Ingredients
**** Sponge
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1/3 cup lukewarm water (90 - 100 degrees)
- 2/3 cup milk at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon honey, maple syrup or malt syrup
- 2 cups (240 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour
**** Dough
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 2 cups water at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 5 - 5 1/2 cups (600 - 660 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour
                       /or/
- 4 - 4 1/2 cups (480 - 540 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour + 1/3 cup (40 grams) stone-ground whole-wheat flour + 1/3 cup (40 grams) rye meal (pumpernickle flour)
*** Method
1. To prepare the sponge: In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over warm water and milk. Stir to dissolve. Add the honey or syrup and flour. Beat with a whisk (or spoon) until smooth. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature at least 4 hours to overnight. This sponge can be stored up to 1 week in the refrigerator before using, if necessary. It will be bubbly.
2. To make the dough: Add the yeast, water, salt and 1 cup of the flour to the sponge. Beat hard with a whisk for 3 minutes or for 1 minute in a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with  the paddle attachment on medium speed. Add the remaining flour 1 cup at a time, switching to a wooden spoon when necessary if making by hand. The dough will be smooth, yet not pull away from the sides of the bowl.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead vigorously until very elastic, yet still moist and tacky, about 5 minutes. This is important for a good, light texture. Slam the dough hard against the work surface to develop the gluten. Set aside uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes. Knead again, and the sticky dough will smooth out without any extra flour. *==> Seriously consider using a machine for kneading; the dough is /extremely/ sticky! <==*
4. Place in an ungreased deep container (plastic is good), cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 3 hours to overnight. The dough should triple in volume.
5. Remove the dough from the container. Place on the work surface, knead lightly into 1 large or 2 small rounds, and flatten slightly. Dust lightly with flour and place in 1 or 2 dusted cloth-lined baskets, or bannetons or on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, smooth side down. Let rise uncovered at room temperature until soft and springy, 1 to 3 hours. Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 400 degrees with a baking stone in it, if desired.
6. /==> Consider *not* scoring the loaves, which pop like balloons! <==/ 
Slash a criss-cross design into the top of the free-form loaves no deeper than 1/4 inch, using a serrated knife. Slide the baking sheet into the hot oven (or carefully invert the loaves directly into the baking tone from the baskets), and bake until very dark and crusty, about 55 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack. This bread is best completely cooled and reheated.

Baking Bread: /Old and New Traditions/ By Beth Hensperger pg 42-43
[2018-04-15 Sun] Boy did I screw up this time! 
I was in a rush in making the sponge and while I used all the Sponge ingredients, I added the amount of flour from /Dough/. It was very dry and I realized what I had done, so I threw in another cup of water. The next day I used just one cup of water and the Sponge flour. It was a bit tough to mix together and the dough was *very* wet. I added even more flour. It came out ok.
** Japanese Milk Bread Rolls
*** Ingredients
**** TANGZHONG (starter)
- 43g (3T) water
- 43g (3T) whole milk
- 14g (2T) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour or Organic Bread Flour
**** DOUGH
- 298g (2.5 cups) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour or Organic Bread Flour
- 18g (2T) Baker's Special Dry Milk or 11g (2T) nonfat dry milk
- 50g (1/4 cup) sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 113g (1/2 cup) whole milk
- 1 large egg
- 57g (1/4 cup; 4T) melted unsalted butter
*** Method
1. To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
2. Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to room temperature.
4. To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead -- by hand, mixer, or bread machine -- until a smooth, elastic dough forms.
5. Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
6. Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 8 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.
7. Place the rolls into a lightly greased round bun pan. Cover the pan, and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy. To use another pan, see "tips," below.
8. Preheat the oven to 350F. Brush the rolls with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and bake for 28 to 32 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll should read at least 190F.
9. Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
*** Yield 8 rolls.

** Black Bread Castelvetrano
To make the "Castelvetrano black bread" of this recipe, I used only the durum wheat flour Russello, Biancolilla and Tumminia (called also timilia); integral, biological and ground stone. More precisely, 31% of Russello, 31% of Biancolilla and 38% of Tumminia.
The following doses are sufficient for two loaves of half weight
around kilo, after cooking.
*** Ingredients
**** TOTALS
- FLOUR (688 g)
    + Tumminia wholemeal flour 262 g
    + Wholemeal flour of Russello 213 g
    + Biancolilla wholemeal flour 213 g
- Total water 505 g
- Sea salt 11 g
- Barley malt 5 g
- Mother yeast 50% hydrated 13.5 g
- Sesame seeds (to garnish) q.b.
**** PREFERMENT
- Flour mix {Tumminia, Russello, Biancolilla} 100% 88 g 
- Water 90% 79 g 
- Solid mother yeast refreshed 50% hydr. 15% 13.5 g 
(TOTAL 180.5 g)
**** FINAL IMPACT Quantity (g)
- Flour mix {Tumminia, Russello, Biancolilla} 100% 600 g
- Preferment (* see table) 30% 180 g
- Water 71% 426 g
- Sea salt 1.9% 11 g
- Barley malt 0.9% 5 g
(TOTAL 1222 g)
*** Method
1) PREFERMENT PREPARATION
   12-14 hours before proceeding to prepare the mixture, prepare the preferment, mixing the quantity of 50% hydrated solid yeast with water at a temperature of about 86/89.6 degreesF (+30/32  degreesC) and flour. Let it ferment in an airtight container. The final temperature of the mixture of the preferment must be about 86/89.6 degreesF (+30/32 degreesC).
2) MIXING OPERATION
   Pass the 12/14 hours necessary to the preferment. 
   In the water, which must have a temperature of about 86/89.6 degrees F (+30/32 degrees C), dissolve the salt. In a bowl large enough, mix the preferment with barley malt and add 80% of the water in which you have previously dissolved the salt, continuing to mix. A little at a time, add the flour and finally the remaining water. Continue until all the flour is hydrated and the dough it will be homogeneous and soft. Then turn it all over a floured work surface and continue to knead for another 5-6 minutes, until the dough will be quite smooth (I advise those who know it to use the method called "stretch and fold" or "slap and fold".)
   Use a kneading machine, after adding all the ingredients in the special mixing bowl for 5 minutes at the slower speed, until you get the correct homogeneity. Complete kneading at medium speed for another minute and a half. When the dough operation will be correct completed, the dough will be quite soft. The final temperature of the desired mix is about 89.6 degrees F (+32 degrees C).
3) FERMENTATION OF THE MIXTURE
   To ferment for 15-20 minutes at most, performing at least 2 sets of folds at intervals of 5-7 minutes.
4) PORTIONING AND FORMING
   Divide the dough into two parts of about 600g each, forming as desired (round loaf or loaf). Pass the upper surface in the seeds of sesame, and store in the appropriate leavening baskets or in cloths for cooks. Let rise with slightly, floured top up.
5) FINAL RISE
   Let rise for 2 or 3 hours depending on the ambient temperature.
6) BAKING
   Bake at 500 degreesF (+260 degreesC) with steam for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 392 degreesF (+200 degreesC) and continue cooking for 20-25 minutes. So conclude with another 10 minutes of draft (door of the ajar oven) to obtain the right degree of humidity.

** Pane Pugliese
Makes 2 loaves
*** Ingredients
**** Biga
0.5 cup (113g) cool water
1.25 cup (149g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/8 teaspoon instant yeast
**** Dough
all of the biga (above)
1.5 cup (340g) lukewarm water
4 cups (482g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon instant yeast
*** Instructions
1. In a small mixing bowl, combine the water, flour, and yeast to form a soft dough. Don't knead it; just make sure all of the ingredients are well-incorporated. Set this mixture aside in a warm place, covered, for 12 to 16 hours; overnight is fine.
2. Knead all of the dough ingredients together, using a mixer or bread machine, until the dough is cohesive and elastic (though not necessarily smooth), about 10 minutes.
3. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours, gently stirring it down each hour. Letting it rise the full 3 hours will enhance the bread's flavor.
4. Lightly grease a half-sheet pan or other flat pan; or line with parchment. Scoop the very wet dough, in two separate pieces, onto the pan lengthwise, shaping each piece into a rough oval as best you can.
5. Cover the dough with heavily greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for about 90 minutes. It'll spread quite a bit; don't worry, it's supposed to. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450 degreesF.
6. Spray the loaves heavily with warm water, and bake them for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're a deep golden brown.
7. Turn the oven off, prop the door open, transfer the loaves from the pan to the oven rack, and allow them to cool in the turned-off oven.

[2018-01-08 Mon] Made two loaves while I worked from home. T & I were both pleased with it overall: light and crusty. Somewhat reminiscent of [[https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-crusty-white-bread-recipe][No-knead crusty white bread]], but with a bit more character.
** Pita Bread
About 2 hours
*** Ingredients
- 2  teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1/2  teaspoon sugar
- 35  grams whole-wheat flour (1/4 cup), preferably freshly milled
- 310  grams unbleached all-purposed flour (2 1/2 cups)
- 1  teaspoon kosher salt
- 2  tablespoons olive oil
*** Method
1. Make sponge: Put 1 cup lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl. Add yeast and sugar. Stir to dissolve. Add the whole-wheat flour and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and whisk together. Put bowl in a warm (not hot) place, uncovered, until mixture is frothy and bubbling, about 15 minutes.
2. Add salt, olive oil and nearly all remaining all-purpose flour (reserve 1/2 cup). With a wooden spoon or a pair of chopsticks, stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass. Dust with a little reserved flour, then knead in bowl for 1 minute, incorporating any stray bits of dry dough.
3. Turn dough onto work surface. Knead lightly for 2 minutes, until smooth. Cover and let rest 10 minutes, then knead again for 2 minutes. Try not to add too much reserved flour; the dough should be soft and a bit moist. (At this point, dough may refrigerated in a large zippered plastic bag for several hours or overnight. Bring dough back to room temperature, knead into a ball and proceed with recipe.)
4. Clean the mixing bowl and put dough back in it. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then cover with a towel. Put bowl in a warm (not hot) place. Leave until dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Heat oven to 475 degrees. On bottom shelf of oven, place a heavy-duty baking sheet, large cast-iron pan or ceramic baking tile. Punch down dough and divide into 8 pieces of equal size. Form each piece into a little ball. Place dough balls on work surface, cover with a damp towel and leave for 10 minutes.
6. Remove 1 ball (keeping others covered) and press into a flat diskc with rolling pin. Roll to a 6-inch circle, then to an 8-inch diameter, about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour if necessary. (The dough will shrink a bit while baking.)
7. Carefully lift the dough circle and place quickly on hot baking sheet. After 2 minutes the dough should be nicely puffed. Turn over with tongs or spatula and bake 1 minute more. The pita should be pale, with only a few brown speckles. Transfer warm pita to a napkin-lined basket and cover so bread stays soft. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.
*** Yield
- 8 six-inch diameter breads

** New York Variation Pizza Dough
*** Dough
**** Ingredients
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 pkg dry yeast
- 3 1/4 cups (390 grams) unbleached flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
**** Method
1. Soften yeast in water.
2. Add salt then start adding flour until a wet dough forms. Knead briefly, just to form a consistent dough. Place ball of dough in a large plastic Ziploc bag (or large bowl) that has been coated with olive oil. Place in refrigerator for 4-5 hours.
3. About the time you turn the oven on to pre-heat, pull dough out of refrigerator. Punch down and then let rest for 10 minutes. Divide ball in half and coat well with flour. Start patting each ball of dough out into a circle, the thinner the better, letting rest if it won't spread out.
4. Place an oven rack at the very lowest position; remove other racks and set aside. Place baking tiles or pizza stone on the rack and preheat the oven to 500 F for an hour or so. Make sure stone is in the oven from the beginning otherwise the high heat might crack it.
***  New York Style Tomato Sauce
**** Ingredients
- 1 can (28 ounces) Italian plum tomatoes - buy the best you can find
- 2 tbl. tomato paste
- 1 or 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
**** Method
1. Crush the tomatoes with your hands or a fork and place in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until thick and flavorful, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat. (This may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen up to 4 months)
2. To bake: Turn the smoke alarm off. Cover pizza peel with coarse corn meal. Place one flattened piece of the dough onto the peel, spread with olive oil, cover with a thick layer of tomato sauce then add toppings. Sprinkle on a thick layer of parmesan cheese then drizzle with olive oil. Slide pizza onto the hot stone and bake 10 to 15 minutes until the top of the pie is beginning to brown. Remove pizza from oven and place on a cutting board. Let sit for a few minutes then slice and eat while hot.

** Rustic Bread
Makes 2 large loaves
*** Ingredients
**** Grains:
- 1/2 cup wheat berries or cracked wheat (optional)
**** Preferment:
- >12.5 oz. water (1 1/2 cups)
- 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 lb. bread flour (3 1/2 cups; 420 grams)
- 1/2 tablespoon (5 grams) salt
**** Final dough:
- 12.5 oz. water (1 1/2 cups)
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 8 oz. bread flour (2  cups; 240 grams)
- 8 oz. whole wheat or rye flour or a mixture of them (around 2 cups; 240 grams)
- 1/4 cup or so flax meal (optional) 
- 1/2 tablespoon (5 grams) salt
- all of the preferment 
*** Method
1. If using grains, soak in water, enough to cover, over night.
2. Put the yeast in the water and stir. Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl and pour in the yeasted water. Mix until the flour is hydrated, adding more water if necessary. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave the pre-ferment out at room temperature overnight (up to 16 hours... if you need more time before baking put it in the refrigerator).
3. To make the final dough, combine all of the ingredients except the pre-ferment in a mixing bowl. Chop the pre-ferment up into small pieces and mix or knead it into the final dough until they are thoroughly combined. This is quite difficult to do by hand: Hamelman assumes the baker has a mixer and can mix it for 5 minutes by machine. I mix and knead my dough by hand for about 10 minutes.
4. Place the dough back in a greased bowl and ferment for 2 1/2 hours, punching down or folding the dough twice during that time.
5. (Folding the dough consists of taking the dough out of the bowl, spreading it out a little on a clean surface, folding it in thirds like a letter, rotating it 90 degrees and folding it up again, and then returning the dough to the bowl and covering it again. Like punching down, folding degases the dough some, but it also encourages gluten development. More on this topic in a future post.)
6. At the end of the fermentation, divide the dough into two pieces and preshape each into a ball. Cover with a clean towel and let each rest for 5 to 10 minutes before shaping into the final shape. Once shaped, cover the loaves with a clean towel and set aside for a final rise, approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
7. Halfway though the final rise, begin preheating the oven to 450 degrees. If you are using a baking stone, preheat it as well.
8. Right before placing it in the oven, score the loaves. Place them in the oven and use whatever technique you use to create stream in the oven (squirt bottle, skillet full of hot water, etc) to encourage proper crust development.
9. After 20 minutes of baking, rotate the loaves 180 degrees so that they'll bake evenly. Bake until an instant read thermometer reads around 200 degrees, which took approximately 35 minutes for my batard ("football") shaped loaves.

** Baron Bagels
*** Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 2/3 cups lukewarm water
- 5 cups (600 grams) bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt, plus more for boiling
- 1 tablespoon diastatic malt powder
- ¼ cup poppy seeds, optional
- ¼ cup sesame seeds, optional
*** Method
1. Put the yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer. Add 1 2/3 cups lukewarm water and allow the yeast to activate, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt and malt powder and mix at low speed for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. Cover the dough and allow to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.
2. Punch the dough down and shape into a rough rectangle about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick, and about 2 times longer than it is wide. If you are having trouble forming the dough, stretch it, wait for the gluten to relax and reform.
3. Cut the dough into 10 pieces of about 3 ounces each. Roll each into an 8-inch-long snakelike shape, tapering the dough at each end. Circle the dough around your hand, pinching the ends together and rolling under your palm once or twice to seal. Put the bagels on a Silpat or other nonstick baking sheet on top of a jellyroll pan. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 10 hours, or up to 24 hours.
4. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. If you have a baking stone or brick you use for baking, put it on a rack near the bottom of the oven; it will retain heat and produce a crisper bagel. Bring a large pot of water to boil, throw a handful of salt into the boiling water and remove the bagels from the refrigerator.
5. Using your hands, carefully place just enough bagels into the pot to cover the surface of the water, making sure that there are no bagels resting on top of one another. Let them float on one side for about 30 seconds before flipping them to the other side for another 30 seconds or so. Remove the bagels and drain well on a cooling rack.
6. Pour poppy or sesame seeds into a bowl wider than the bagels. Working very quickly, remove the bagels one by one and dip them into the topping. Place them back on the Silpat-covered baking sheet, topping side down.
7. Bake on the second to highest shelf of the oven for about 7 minutes. Then flip the bagels and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

**** [2016-07-03 Sun] Made for Tracey and Doris who liked the flavor. They were rather flat. I made a dozen; perhaps try for 10 next time?
**** [2016-08-27 Sat] 
1. Replaced about 40g of flour with high gluten flour.
2. I diced a small jalapeño into two of the bagels and sprinkled locatelli on them too. They tasted good
3. Baking: stone on the bottom shelf, cooked on the top. I baked for 7 minutes on one side and then about 10 on the other, the last 3 with speed bake (since they weren't browning). But they were underdone in the middle.
4. Next time should be 7 minutes on one side, 7 minutes on the other, then speed bake for 2 minutes then flip for 2 minutes.
5. These were not good bagels: tasted ok, but were quite gummy, even after toasting. I think I used /way/ too much gluten; perhaps a tablespoon or two next time?

** Buttermilk Scones with Raisins
By Donna Pilato, About.com
- It's difficult to picture a tea party that doesn't have at least one scone on the menu. Here is a simple recipe for buttermilk scones that turn out fluffy and buttery in absolutely no time. They're best served warm from the oven, but are still pretty tasty the following day.
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes
*** Ingredients
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 3/4 cup buttermilk, or slightly more as needed
*** Method
1. Preparation:
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
3. Mix thoroughly the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl with a whisk or spoon.
4. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the raisins. Using a large spoon, blend in buttermilk until a soft dough forms.
5. Place dough on a floured board and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into six squares, then cut each square again on the diagonal. Place triangles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.
*** Yield Makes 12 scones.

** Buttermilk Syrup
*** Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 tablespoon Light karo syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*** Method
1. In a large pot or saucepan over medium heat add the butter, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla and karo syrup. Heat until everything is well combined and bring to a boil.  
2. Quickly remove the pot from the heat and add the baking soda, place back over the heat, stirring constantly. The syrup will grow large and threaten to boil over which is why a large pot is essential. If it gets too close to the edge remove from the burner and continue stirring to bring it down. 
3. Stir for 30 seconds over the heat (I often just take mine off so I don't risk boiling over) and serve immediately.

** Fruit and Nut Muffins
By Kim Carlson, from the Culinate Kitchen collection
Although I used to be a fan of super-sweet and cakey muffins, that's
no longer the case. But I still love the little package that a muffin
represents-- it's an easy snack.
I came up with this recipe, and although it contains only a relatively
little sugar, the fruit adds plenty of sweetness.
I hope you'll experiment with the amount of sugar you like.
Serve these muffins with butter and honey -- or not.
*** Ingredients
- 1 	cup whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- ¼ 	cup sugar (or less; see Note)
- 1 	tsp. baking powder
- ½ 	tsp. baking soda
- ½ 	tsp. salt
- 2 	large eggs
- ½ 	cup low-fat buttermilk
- ¼ 	cup canola oil
- 1 	cup ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 	cup frozen blueberries
- ½ 	cup chopped and toasted nuts, such as hazelnuts (optional)
*** Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-muffin pan with paper
   baking cups.
2. Combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in
   a large mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and oil in a 4-cup glass
   measuring cup with a pour spout or a medium bowl. Stir in the
   mashed bananas.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a
   rubber spatula, stir just until blended. Fold in the blueberries
   and nuts.
5. Fill the muffin cups ¾ full (add more batter to each cup if you
   have extra). Bake for 20 minutes, then check to see if the muffins
   are browning. If they need more time, bake 5 minutes longer.
6. Cool for 10 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature.
*** Yield 	12 muffins

- I've made these muffins with just two tablespoons of sugar and
  without any sugar at all. Both options are good.

** Lauren Groveman's Bagels
*** Ingredients
- 3 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, for brushing
- 2 cups tepid water or any combination of slightly warmed milk and water to equal 2 cups, plus 1/4 cup tepid water, for yeast
- 3 rounded tablespoons (40.9 grams) solid vegetable shortening
- 1 package (7 grams) active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar or 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon liquid (not dry) barley malt extract, plus 1/4 cup sugar for when boiling the bagels
- 1 tablespoon fine table-salt
- 1 to 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, optional
- Up to 6 cups (720 grams) high-gluten flour, including flour for dusting.
    + I prefer to use "super-gluten" flour, which I purchase at my neighborhood pizza place.
    + If unavailable, use a supermarket brand of bread flour.
- For the boiling water bath: Boiling water, as needed, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon baking soda
- Glaze: 2 egg whites, at room temperature, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water
*** Method
1. Brush the interior of a 5-quart mixing bowl with melted butter and set aside for rising the dough.
2. To assemble liquid mixture: If using milk, heat in a medium-sized saucepan over medium-low heat until just warm throughout. Pour the milk into a large mixing bowl and add shortening and 1/2 cup lukewarm water. (If the milk became too hot, let it cool until just warm.) If not using milk, pour the 2 cups lukewarm water into a mixing bowl and add the shortening (no need to melt). Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup lukewarm water with a pinch of the sugar. When yeast is creamy and starts to bubble, add to mixing bowl with 2 tablespoons of the sugar or the barley malt extract, salt and black pepper, if using.
3. To complete and knead the dough: Briskly stir in enough flour, a cup or so at a time, to make dough that is not easily stirred in the bowl. Turn out the dough onto a floured wooden board and knead in a brisk push, fold and turning motion, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Add only as much additional flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking to your hands and work surface. As always, use a pastry scraper while kneading to scrape dough off the board cleanly as you continue to knead in a sufficient amount of flour.
4. To rise the dough: Place the dough in the buttered bowl. Brush top of the dough with more melted butter, and then cover with buttered plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for 1 hour (or up to 2 1/2 hours for an extremely light and flavorful bagel). Uncover bowl and punch down dough with several swift swats with the back of your hand. Recover bowl and refrigerate dough for 4 hours or, preferably, overnight (and up to two days!!).
5. To set up for shaping bagels: Position the rack to the lower third of the oven.
     a. If using a large pizza stone, place it on the oven rack and sprinkle a baker's peel generously with cornmeal and, if desired, a combination of seeds (poppy, sesame and caraway).
     b. Otherwise, brush or spray a large dark steel shallow baking sheet with vegetable oil and sprinkle the interior as described above. Place an (empty) heat proof pan on the rack underneath the tiles or stone.
     c. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F at least 30 minutes before you plan to shape, boil and bake bagels. (If working with a double oven, preheat the second oven as well). Pour the prepared egg-white glaze through a small medium-mesh sieve into another bowl to remove excess coagulation. Set the glaze next to your work surface. While the oven preheats, bring one or two large pots of water to a rapid boil. Lay a clean kitchen towel on each of 2 shallow trays or baking sheets (for 10 bagels) and sprinkle the towels lightly with flour.
6. To shape bagels: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Punch the chilled dough down, with several swift blows, until totally deflated. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Using the blade of a pastry scraper, divide the dough in half. I recommend baking only 5 bagels at a time (per oven) so each has enough space around it to bake properly. If not working with a double oven, place half of dough back in bowl, cover and refrigerate. Divide each half of dough into 5 equal pieces (for 10 in all). You'll work with 1 piece at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered with a towel. Shape one piece of dough into a very tight, round ball by drawing dough up and pinching it at the top. Keep pinching and pulling upward, always keeping ball on a lightly floured board to prevent sticking. The ball should be perfectly round with the exception of a little knot of pinched dough on top. Turn ball (knot side down) and flatten gently. Push your index finger through the center of dough (right where the knot was). Gently stretch the hole, while being careful not to tear the rim, until hole measures about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter (the hole will shrink after rising and baking). As each bagel is shaped, place it on the prepared towel-lined trays spaced 2 inches apart. Cover bagels with another clean towel.
7. To boil the bagels: Add 1/4 cup sugar and the baking soda to the pot of boiling water. Bring 1 tray of risen bagels over to the stove and carefully lower 2 to 4 bagels into the water (one at a time). Bagels should be able to sit freely in the water without touching and will expand in the water. Once the bagels rise to the top of the pot, continue to boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, turning with a large round slotted skimmer or a large slotted spoon. After bagels have cooked on the second side, remove them with spatula (draining water) and drain on a kitchen towel (smoothest side up). Repeat with the remaining bagels
8. To glaze and top the bagels:  Place bagels (again, smoothest side up) on the prepared baker's peel or baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, paint boiled bagels with egg-white glaze. Don't worry if the glazed bagels seem wrinkled; this will smooth in the oven. When all of the bagels have been boiled and positioned on the peel or baking sheet, brush tops and sides of bagels once more with glaze. Sprinkle the desired toppings on each bagel or just glaze and leave plain. (Try not to let the glaze fall into puddles around bagels or into hole as this makes bagel dough stick to the peel. (Having the egg whites at room temperature and straining, helps remove their clumsy gelatinous quality.)
9. To bake the bagels: Just before baking, place the ice cubes and a few tablespoons water into a cup and pour this into the pan that sits below the baker's stone. If using tiles, place baker's peel all the way to the back of the hot oven and with a swift jerk; remove the peel, leaving the bagels on the hot tiles (or place baking sheet on hot oven rack). Reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees F and bake for ~25 minutes (If working with a convection oven, bake the bagels at 450 for 20 minutes. Keep the rest of the instructions the same.); turn oven off and allow bagels to sit there for 5 minutes. Open oven and allow bagels to sit in oven for 5 minutes more. Remove bagels to wire racks when uniformly golden and crisp. Cool thoroughly before storing.
10. To prepare the oven for the remaining batch of bagels (if not using a double oven): Before reheating the oven to 500 degrees F, sweep away any excess cornmeal and seeds from the tiles and onto a baking sheet to discard, using a cornmeal sweeper. (This is to prevent burning and smoking.) Preheat the oven, boil, and glaze, top and bake remaining bagels as described above.)
11. To store: Store cooled bagels to be served on the day of baking in a paper bag. Store the remaining bagels in a jumbo-sized, heavy-duty plastic bag, at room temperature. Bagels also freeze well in well-sealed freezer bags. To thaw, remove from the freezer the night before and allow bagels to thaw, overnight, in the sealed bag.

From Sarah's friend Kristen
[2019-01-27 Sun] Made for brunch at Jan and Dan's with Nancy and Pat. Overall, pleased with the results.
- I added about 1 Tbsp of gluten to the flour.
- I let the dough rise for about 2.5 hours and then put it in the refrigerator for the rest of the day.
- I formed the bagels just before going to bed.
- In the morning, I took the bagels from the refrigerator; they had puffed a bit and closed the hole somewhat. I used two chopsticks to open the hole and kept them covered and out for 2 hours.
- At bath time, I boiled water and added 4 Tbsps of non-diastatic malt. Big mistake! It boiled over all over the stove. I should take it down to a simmer.
- After the bath, instead of drying the bagels on towels, I used racks for the first few. Mistake: they are highly impressionable. Towels on top of racks is fine.
- I baked them on the pizza stone, using convection for 20 minutes with a pan of boiling water. Then 5 minutes with the oven off and the door closed, then 5 minutes with the door open before letting them cool on the rack.
    + They were good, but I'd like them to be a bit crispier.
    + Perhaps I ought to remove the pan half-way through?
[2016-09-23 Fri]: Modifications:
- I used 1 cup water + 1 cup milk
    - Should try 1.5 cup water + .5 cup milk
- I added 1.5 tablespoons gluten flour.
    - Should cut back to 1 tablespoon.
- I added (slightly more than) 1 tablespoon diastatic malt powder.
    - Should try molasses or, better yet, malt syrup.
- Some say each bagel ought to weigh between 2.5 - 3 oz (70 - 85 grams), but others liked them in the 120-140 gram range.
    - I used ~130g and this was the right size! I got 10 good-sized bagels out of this recipe.
- In the morning, let dough warm for about an hour(!). Then after forming the bagels, let them rise for another 1 hour.
    - This seems crucial!
- https://cookingupastory.com/authentic-east-coast-bagels
- I'm not sure how long I baked them (T did a Google Hangout from Chicago in the middle and I never set the timer). It was probably a bit shy of 20 minutes, but the exteriors were as brown as I'd want them. They were a bit doughy in the middle, but the exterior was great: crisp and just a tad chewy.
- I had pre-heated the oven to 500 degrees for an hour (made some granola in it, which worked fine) then turned down to 450 degrees before I baked.
    - I should probably have turned it down sooner.
- I attempted to use a SilPat: a mistake. I couldn't easily get the SilPat off the peel onto the stone. I wound up putting the bagels directly on the stone (sans corn meal) and they stuck and oozed.
    - Next time: use parchment!

1. Beat egg with hand beater until fluffy; beat in remaining ingredients just until smooth. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional ¼ cup milk.
2. Grease heated griddle if necessary. (To test griddle, sprinkle with few drops water. If bubbles skitter around, heat is just right.)
3. Pour about 3 tablespoons batter from tip of large spoon or from pitcher onto hot griddle. Cook pancakes until puffed and dry around edges. Turn and cook other sides until golden brown. (To keep pancakes hot, stack on hot plate with paper towel in between.)
4. About six 4-inch pancakes.

** Claridge’s Scones
*** Ingredients
- 11 1/2	ounces (330 g.) plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 2 1/4	ounces (60 g.) caster sugar
- 1 1/2	tablespoons baking powder
- 1/4	teaspoon salt
- 3 1/4	ounces cold unsalted butter, cubed
- 2 1/2	ounces (70 g.) raisins (optional)
- 3 3/4	ounces (fluid ounce) (110 ml.) buttermilk
- 3	ounces (fluid ounce) (90 ml.) milk
- 1	beaten with a pinch of salt, for the egg wash
*** Method
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt, then add the butter and rub into the flour mixture with your fingers until you have a fine crumb (you could also pulse this five to six times in a food processor to achieve the same sandy texture, but it’s almost as fast to work by hand).
2. If you’re making raisin scones, stir the raisins in now.
3. Transfer to a smaller container, cover and leave to rest in the refrigerator overnight, or until thoroughly chilled.
4. The next morning, preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit (240 degrees Celsius), Gas Mark 9.
5. Transfer the butter and flour mixture to the standing mixer. Slowly mix in the buttermilk and milk until the dough comes together.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to form a circle, about 8 inches (21 cm.) in diameter and 3/4 inch (2 cm.) thick, then cut out 12 scones using the pastry cutter. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking tray.
7. Using a pastry brush, carefully brush the tops with the egg wash. We like to let our scones sit out for 20 minutes at room temperature to give the baking powder a chance to activate before we bake them.
8. Bake until evenly golden, about 12–13 minutes. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then serve warm.
9. To serve: We strongly suggest serving these only on the day of baking. Leftover scones can be frozen and will remain good for up to three weeks: as needed, defrost completely, then reheat in a preheated 350 degree Fahrenheit (180 degree Celsius), Gas Mark 4 oven for 3 minutes.

[2019-03-17 Sun]: Made for TC. The batter was /very/ sticky. I couldn't think of slicing the dough, so I used a biscuit cutter to roughly shape and move a bit of dough to the pan. The cutter I used was too large (4"?) so I lowered the heat to 450 degrees, but the scones turned out fine. (I did have them spend a bit of time on convection to crisp them up.) I also sprinkled with some coarse sugar. Oh yeah, and half of the flour I used was [[https://www.whitelily.com/white-lily-biscuits][White Lily]]. And oh yeah, instead of raisins, I threw some frozen blueberries in. The dough turned purple, but it was ok.

- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 1 1/2 cups diced strawberries, divided
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 4 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- Unsalted butter, for cooking
- Maple syrup, for serving
*** Method
1. Cut a wide pocket into each slice of bread without cutting all the way through the bread.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheese, vanilla extract, lemon juice, lemon zest and 1/2 cup diced strawberries until well combined, about 2 minutes.
3. Slather a portion of the cream cheese mixture inside each bread pocket and press each bread pocket closed.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, cinnamon and sugar.
5. Place a large pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted, dip each stuffed slice of toast into the egg mixture on all sides and shake off any excess. Place the bread immediately into the pan and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Flip once and continue cooking until golden, about 2 minutes. Repeat the coating the cooking process with the remaining slices of bread. (Do not overcrowd the pan.)
6. Serve the French toast immediately topped with maple syrup and the remaining diced strawberries.

**** Kelly's Note:
Any variety of bread will work in this recipe. A few of my favorites include a loaf of sourdough, a French baguette or (extra-thick) Texas toast. Use whatever type of bread you prefer, however stale bread works best for French Toast, as it absorbs the most liquid.
**** My Notes:
- [2016-07-17 Sun] Made for Colwills, Doris and TC. Good, but /way/ too lemony... even though I used about half the zest and none of the lemon juice.

** Apple Twist Bread
*** Ingredients
**** DOUGH
- 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 43g potato flour OR dry instant mashed potatoes, unflavored*
- 35g granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 43g soft butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 255g room-temperature or lukewarm milk
- *For an alternative, see tips, below.
**** FILLING
- 170g to 227g peeled, grated apple (283g to 340g whole apples)
- 14g lemon juice
- 99g granulated sugar
- 21g cornstarch or Instant ClearJel
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 113g chopped walnuts or pecans, optional
**** GLAZE
- 113g confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 14g to 28g water OR 28g to 57g heavy cream
*** Method
1. To make the dough: Whisk together all of the dry ingredients, then add the butter, vanilla, egg, and milk, mixing until a shaggy dough forms. If your schedule permits, let the dough rest for 30 minutes; this resting period allows the flour to absorb the liquid fully, making it easier to knead.
2. Knead the dough - by hand, using a mixer, or in a bread machine set on the dough cycle - until it's smooth and soft, though still slightly sticky. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until it's almost doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The amount of time this takes will depend on the temperature of your kitchen; yeast works the fastest at about 85 degreesF, but we prefer the flavor the bread gets from a longer, cooler (about 70 degreesF) rise. If you're using a bread machine set on the dough cycle, simply allow it to complete its cycle.
3. While the dough is rising, make the filling.
4. To make the filling using cornstarch: Toss the grated apple with the lemon juice in a saucepan. Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon, and add to the pan, stirring to combine. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the apple starts to release its juice. Increase the heat to medium, and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring, until the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes; drawing a spatula across the bottom of the pan should leave a track that doesn't readily fill in. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature; if you want to hasten the process, place in the refrigerator.
5. To make the filling using Instant ClearJel: Whisk together the sugar, ClearJel, salt, and cinnamon. Toss the grated apple with the lemon juice, then add that to the sugar mixture. Mix well, and set aside.
6. To assemble the loaf: Gently deflate the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured or greased work surface. Divide the dough in half. Roll the first half into a 10" x 12" rectangle. Spread half the filling over the rolled-out dough, leaving a 1/2" margin clear of filling along all sides. If adding chopped nuts, sprinkle them evenly over the filling.
7. Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log, sealing the edge. Use a bench knife, pizza cutter, or sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthwise. Place the half-logs, filled side up, side by side on a well-greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Keeping the filling side up, twist or "braid" the two logs together, working from the center to each end. Pinch the ends together. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the twists lightly, and set them aside to rise for 1 to 2 hours; they should be puffy but not doubled in bulk. Want to make the bread ahead, then refrigerate overnight and bake the next morning? See "tips," below.
8. To bake the bread: Bake the loaves in a preheated 350 degreesF oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Check the loaves after 20 minutes and tent with aluminum foil if they're browning too quickly. When the loaves are fully baked, a digital thermometer inserted into a loaf (be sure to position the thermometer in the bread, not the filling) should register about 190 degreesF. Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool for about 1 hour before glazing and serving.
9. To make the glaze: Mix together all of the glaze ingredients. Drizzle over the loaves once they're cool.
10. Store leftover bread, loosely covered, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage. If you know ahead of time you're going to freeze one or both of the loaves, don't glaze; wrap completely cooled, unglazed bread tightly in plastic, and freeze for up to a month. When ready to serve, remove from the freezer, unwrap, cover loosely with plastic, and let thaw at room temperature. Glaze and serve.

** Blueberry Hand Pies
*** Ingredients
- 2 cups (240g; 8 1/2 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup (16 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup cold sour cream
- 2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch or 1 tablespoon Instant ClearJel (/For frozen berries, use 2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch or 1 1/2 tablespoons ClearJel/)
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt (a large pinch)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
*** Method
**** The Dough
1. First, make the pastry. Gather the first group of ingredients.
2. Cut the cold butter into small cubes or thin pats. A baker's bench knife is ideal for this task.
3. Whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the butter.
4. Work the butter in, but leave most of it in large, pea-sized pieces. You'll have a coarse, crumbly mixture.
5. Add the sour cream, and stir until the mixture starts to come together in chunks.
6. Turn it out onto a floured work surface and bring it together with a few quick kneads.
7. Pat the dough into a rough log. Roll it into an 8" x 10" rectangle. Dust both sides of the dough with flour, and starting with a shorter end, fold it in three like a business letter.
8. Give the dough a 90 degrees turn on your work surface, and roll it again into an 8" x 10" rectangle. Fold it in three again.
9. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Chill for at least 30 minutes before using.
**** The Filling
1. If you're using fresh berries, rinse and drain well. Place fresh or frozen berries in a saucepan. Whisk the cornstarch or ClearJel with the sugar, and pour over the berries. Add the salt and lemon juice, stirring to combine.
2. Place the saucepan on a burner set to medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the small amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan comes to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the cooked berries to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. It's fine to make the filling ahead of time, and refrigerate until you're ready to use it.
**** Putting Everything Together
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degreesF; place a rack on the middle shelf. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll the dough into a 14" x 14" square. With a straight edge and pastry wheel, or a 3 1/2" square cutter, cut out sixteen 3 1/2" squares.
3. Divide the filling among eight of the squares, using about a heaping tablespoon for each; a slightly heaped tablespoon cookie scoop works well here.
4. Whisk 1 large egg until frothy. Brush some of the beaten egg along the edges of each filled square.
5. Use a knife to cut a vent into each of the remaining eight squares; or use a decorative cutter of your choice.
6. Top each filled square with a vented square, and press along the edges with the tines of a fork to seal.
7. Note: If at any time during assembly the pies become sticky and hard to work with, simply refrigerate them for about 20 minutes, until firm.   /Strongly recommended!/
8. Brush the top of each pie with the remaining beaten egg and sprinkle with sparkling sugar. The sugar's a nice touch: it adds both flavor and crunch.
9. Bake the pies for 18 to 20 minutes, until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven.
10. Let the pies cool for 20 minutes before serving.
11. Store pies, lightly wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days; freeze for longer storage (if they last that long!).

    + Made them for T's breakfast.
    + The pastry was light and flaky if a wee bit greasy.
    + I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter for the vent and simply offset the cut-out onto the pastry.
    + Half of the pies looked really good.
    + The others: not so much.
    + The problem was in the final (14x14) rolling: the middle was a bit thick (not much of a problem) but the extremities were very thin and not quite square. This made pulling up those square difficult.
    + After rolling I did pop them in the refrigerator for ~20 minutes which helped a heck of a lot.
- [2017-11-11 Sat]
    + *DO NOT USE WAX PAPER UNDER THE PIES!* (They stick!)
    + I used 4 cups of strawberries, which made me go wild with filling. I think I filled some way too much. Not a help!

** Chocolate Chip Cookies
*** Ingredients
- 1 cup unbleached flour (I use King Arthur - organic if I can find it)
- 1 cup King Arthur white or regular whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup quick cooking oatmeal (uncooked) I use what I have on hand, not necessarily quick cooking.
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. coarse salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1 lb premium quality bittersweet chocolate (see note below) cut into medium-sized chunks.
- 2 cups walnuts, coarsely chopped (the Supreme Cookie Dude aka Pat, likes big chunks of nuts and lots of!)
*** Method
1. About the chocolate: I do not use chocolate chips because IMHO the better the chocolate, the better the cookie.
2. If I can't afford the really good stuff I don't make these. I like to use Valhrona bittersweet chocolate that comes
3. in thin bars (not sure of the weight but the bars are around 6" by 3" and maybe  1/2" deep -- I use several) so that
4. the chocolate is sort of in layers in the cookie. Scharffen Berger, Green and Black's dark baking, and Callebaut
5. all work well. The best buy is from Trader Joe's though (sorry, Jen!!!) and it's their 1 lb. Plus bars which are
6. actually made by Callebaut. I use either the 72% (especially if making these cookies for adults) or the Dark
7. Chocolate (which is closer to semi-sweet and better for kids). But they also have the best price around on
8. Valhrona too.
9. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream together
10. butter and sugars. Blend in vanilla and egg. Slowly add in the flour mixture until nearly combined. Add in
11. chocolate chips and nuts and stir by in by hand (this is normally Pat's job). It may seem like the dough won't
12. handle all the chocolate and nuts but it does. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto baking sheets (I use one of
13. those cool cookie scoops that has the releasing mechanism) - you can put them very close together. Refrigerate
14. for 24 hours or longer (or freeze) then I take out only what I need for one pan at a time and bake on sheets.
15. These are great to have in the freezer to bake at a moment's notice - do not thaw or allow to come to room temp
16. before baking.
17. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or use silpat sheets and preheat over to 350o. Bake one sheet at a
18. time for 7 minutes, then turn sheets around 180o and bake for another 6 minutes until lightly browned. (Your
19. oven may run hotter or colder than mine but this it what works in mine). Remove pan from the oven but leave
20. cookies on the paper and slip the paper onto a wire rack to cool. Since there's so much chocolate in these and
21. it's in big pieces, if you take the cookies off the paper the chocolate will drip while it's still hot.
*** Yield Makes 48 cookies.

** Chocolate Cream Pie
*** Ingredients
**** Crust
- 181g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 46g vegetable shortening
- 57g (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter
- 28 to 57g ice water
**** Filling
- 28g unsalted butter
- 227g semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 131g granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 11g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for richer chocolate flavor
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 3 large egg yolks
- 227g heavy cream, divided
- 454g milk
**** Topping
- 227g heavy cream
- 28g confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
*** Method
**** Crust
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, and salt.
2. Cut in the shortening until it's in lumps the size of small peas.
3. Dice the butter into 1/2" pieces, and cut into the mixture until you have flakes of butter the size of your fingernail.
4. Add the water, two tablespoons at a time, mixing with a fork as you sprinkle the water into the dough.
5. When the dough is moist enough to hold together when you squeeze it, transfer it to a piece of wax or parchment paper. It's ok if there are dry spots in the pile. Use a spray bottle of water to lightly spritz these places; that way you'll add just enough water to bring the dough together without adding too much or creating a wet spot.
6. Fold it over on itself three or four times to bring it together, then pat it into a disk 3/4" thick
7. Roll the disk on its edge, like a wheel, to smooth out the edges. This step will ensure your dough will roll out evenly, without a lot of cracks and splits at the edges later. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.
8. To blind bake the crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degreesF. Lightly grease a 9" pie pan that's at least 2" deep. This will make serving the pie easier after it's finished.
9. Roll out the pastry for the pie to a 13" circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan, and trim the edges so they overlap the edge by an inch all the way around. Tuck the edges up and under, and flute them. Put the lined pie pan in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes.
10. Line the crust with foil or parchment paper, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crust for 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and gently remove foil or parchment with the weights or beans. Return the crust to the oven for 10 to 20 more minutes, until it's golden brown all over. If the edges of the crust start becoming too brown, cover them with a pie shield, or strips of aluminum foil. Remove the crust from the oven and cool completely.
**** Filling
1. Place the chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in a 2-quart mixing bowl; set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan away from heat, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa, espresso powder, and salt. Whisk in 1/4 cup of cold heavy cream until the mixture is smooth, with no lumps. Repeat with another 1/4 cup of the cream. Whisk in the egg yolks.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and gradually whisk in the remaining cream and milk.
4. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly as the mixture thickens; boil for 1 minute.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture over the reserved chocolate and butter.
6. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
7. (optionally) Pass the filling through a strainer into a bowl to remove any lumps.
8. Place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and chill thoroughly.
**** Topping
1. Place the heavy cream in a chilled mixing bowl.
2. Whip until the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl.
3. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until the cream holds a medium peak.
4. Assembly
5. Transfer the cooled filling to the cooled, baked pie crust. Level the top with the back of a spoon or an offset spatula.
6. Spoon or pipe the whipped cream on top.
7. Chill the pie until ready to serve. Note: If you're not planning on serving the entire pie at once, top individual slices with a dollop of whipped cream just before serving.
***** Variation: Meringue topping
****** Ingredients
- 3 large egg whites (reserved from filling)
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) sugar
- 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) water
****** Method
1. Place the egg whites in a clean bowl with clean beaters. Add the pinch of salt.
2. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.
3. Whip the egg whites until they turn white and the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl. Slowly add the hot sugar syrup, and continue beating until the whites make stiff peaks.
4. Preheat the oven to 400 degreesF.
5. Pipe or spoon the meringue over the top of the filled, chilled pie, making sure you cover the filling completely.
6. Place the pie in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the meringue is golden brown. Remove from the oven and refrigerate until ready to serve

*** Notes
**** <2016-02-28 Sun> 
Made at T's request. Good pie, but the crust was a bit hard/tough. Overworked and over cooked? 
Pudding was good. I used well-ground coffee beans and didn't strain it.

** Classic Pie Crust (King Arthur)
*** Ingredients
**** 2 Crusts
- 297g (2 1/2 cups) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or 283g King Arthur Perfect Pastry Blend
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt*
- 46g (1/4 cup) vegetable shortening
- 142g (10 tablespoons) very cold unsalted butter
- 85g to 142g (6 to 10 tablespoons) ice water**
**** 1 Crust
- 148.5g (1 1/4 cups) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or 141.5g King Arthur Perfect Pastry Blend
- 3/8 teaspoons salt*
- 23g (1/8 cup) vegetable shortening
- 71g (5 tablespoons) very cold unsalted butter
- 42.5g to 71g (3 to 5 tablespoons) ice water**
**** Notes
**Reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon (1/2 teaspoon for single crust) if you use salted butter.
***Use the lesser amount of water if you use Perfect Pastry Blend.
*** Method
1. Whisk together the flour and salt.
2. Add the shortening, working it in until the mixture is evenly crumbly.
3. Cut the butter into small (about ½") cubes.
4. Add the butter to the flour mixture, and work it in roughly with your fingers, a pastry cutter, or a mixer. Don't be too thorough; the mixture should be very uneven, with big chunks of butter in among the smaller ones.
5. Add 4 (or 2 for single crust) tablespoons of water, and toss to combine.
6. Toss with enough additional water to make a chunky, fairly cohesive mixture. It should hold together when you gather it up and squeeze it in your hand.
7. Divide the dough in half, and gather each half into a rough disk. Smooth the disks; it's OK if they have a few cracks in the surface. Smooth the disks' edges by running them along a floured surface like a wheel.
8. Wrap in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes, or up to overnight. Or wrap in aluminum foil over the plastic, and freeze for up to 2 months.
9. When you're ready to make pie, remove the crust from the refrigerator or freezer, leaving it wrapped. Allow it to thaw (if it's frozen) or warm a bit (if it's been chilled longer than 30 minutes), until it's softened enough to roll, but still feels cold to the touch.
10. Next, measure the bottom diameter, and up the sides of your pie pan. If your pan is 7" across the bottom, and 1 ½" up each side, that's a total of 10". This means you should roll your bottom crust to a diameter between 11" and 12", which gives you enough extra for crimping the edges.
11. Place the crust on a floured work surface; our silicone rolling mat is a fine choice. Roll it to the desired width. See the big chunks of butter? That's a good thing.
12. Place the crust in the pan by folding in quarters and placing in the pan. Or you can simply pick it up with a piecrust lifter, and move it that way.
13. For a single-crust pie, fold the edges of the crust under, and gently squeeze them together. Crimp as desired. It's nice to make a tall crimp, as the filling for a single-crust pie is usually fairly liquid (think pumpkin or custard), and it's good to have that tall "dam."
14. For a double-crust pie, leave the edges of the bottom crust as is (no folding or crimping). Once you've added the pie filling, roll out the top crust to the outside diameter of your pan, and place it atop the filling.
15. Trim excess crust with a pair of scissors, then press the two edges together.
16. Crimp as desired. A simple fork crimp is fast and easy. At this point, it helps to return the pie to the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes; this chills the fat, which ultimately increases the crust's flakiness.
17. Cut a hole in the center of the crust for steam to escape. Or slash the pie's top surface several times.
18. Brush with milk and sprinkle with coarse sparkling sugar, if desired.
19. Bake... enjoy!

** Classic Single Pie Dough
*** Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cups (150g | 6.25 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 4 Tbsp. (23g) vegetable shortening, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled
- 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled
- About 3-4 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed
*** Method
1. Process flour, sugar and salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter shortening over top and process until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses.
2. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of ice water over mixture. Stir and press dough together, using stiff rubber spatula, until dough sticks together. If dough does not come together, stir in remaining ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until it does.
3. Divide dough into 2 even pieces. Turn each piece of dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten each into 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling out dough, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)

** Flaky Pie Crust
From the book How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman
*** Ingredients
- For any single-crust pie, 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Double the recipe for a two-crust pie.
- 1(?) cups (about 5 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting work surface
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 8 Tbsp. (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into about 8 pieces
- About 3 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed
*** Method
1. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the container of a food processor; pulse once or twice. Add the butter and turn on the machine; process until the butter and flour are blended and the mixture looks like cornmeal, about 10 seconds.
2. Place the mixture in a bowl and sprinkle 3 tablespoons of water over it. Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to gradually gather the mixture into a ball; if the mixture seems dry, add another 1/2 tablespoon ice water. When you can make the mixture into a ball with your hands, do so. Wrap in plastic wrap, flatten into a small disk, and freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate for 30 minutes); this will ease rolling. (You can also refrigerate the dough for a day or two, or freeze it almost indefinitely.)
3. You can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap, usually quite successfully; sprinkle both sides of it with a little more flour, then proceed. Or sprinkle a countertop or large board with flour. Unwrap the dough and place it on the work surface; sprinkle its top with flour. If the dough is hard, let it rest for a few minutes; it should give a little when you press your fingers into it.
4. Roll with light pressure, from the center out. (If the dough seems very sticky at first, add flour liberally; but if it becomes sticky only after you roll it for a few minutes, return it to the refrigerator for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Continue to roll, adding small amounts of flour as necessary, rotating the dough occasionally, and turning it over once or twice during the process. (Use ragged edges of dough to repair any tears, adding a drop of water while you press the patch into place.) When the dough is about 10 inches in diameter (it will be less than 1/4-inch thick), place your pie plate upside down over it to check the size.
5. Move the dough into the pie plate by draping it over the rolling pin or by folding it into quarters, then moving it into the plate and unfolding it. When the dough is in the plate, press it firmly into the bottom, sides, and junction of bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough to about 1/2 inch all around, then tuck it under itself around the edge of the plate. Decorate the edges with a fork or your fingers. Freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate it for 30 minutes).
6. When you're ready to bake, prick it all over with a fork.

** Lemon Cornmeal Cake with Lemon Glaze and Crushed-Blueberry Sauce Glaze:
*** Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups (packed) powdered sugar, sifted
- 2 tablespoons (or more) fresh lemon Juice
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon peel
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- Crushed-Blueberry Sauce
*** Method
1) For glaze: Combine powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in small bowl. Stir with spoon until smooth and paste-like, adding more lemon juice by 1/2 teaspoonfuls if glaze is too thick to spread. Set aside.
2) For cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides; line bottom with parchment. Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, lemon peel, and vanilla in small bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture and melted butter into flour mixture. Using rubber spatula, gently fold liquids into flour mixture until just blended (do not stir). Scrape batter into pan; spread evenly.
3) Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean and cake pulls away from sides of pan, about 30 minutes.
4) Immediately run knife around sides of cake. Place rack atop cake in pan. Using oven mitts, hold pan and rack firmly together and invert cake onto rack. Remove pan from cake. Place another rack on bottom of cake; invert 1 more time so that cake is top side up. Stir glaze until blended. While cake is still very hot, drop glaze by tablespoonfuls onto cake; spread to within 1/2 inch of edge (some glaze may drip down sides of cake). Cool completely. Serve with Crushed-Blueberry Sauce.

** Peach Melba Cream Cake
*** For the cake:
**** Ingredients
- 3/4 cup softened, unsalted butter plus more for greasing the pans
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
- 4 pounds ripe peaches
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
**** Method
1) Raspberry Melba Sauce (see recipe)
2) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans (line with buttered and floured wax paper for easier removal, optional).
3) Cream the 3/4 cup butter and sugars in a mixing bowl. Addd the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each adition. Beat in the vanilla, lemon zest and juice.
4) Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; add to mixture in the bowl, alternating with buttermilk, to make batter.
5) Scrape batter into the pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a rack for 15 minutes, then turn them out onto the rack, peel off wax paper and cool completely.
6) Shortly before serving, peel, pit and slice the peaches. Toss with lemon juice and 1 tablespoon sugar; set aside for 15 minutes.
7) Whip the cream with the vanilla and the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar until it holds soft peaks.
8) Place on cake on a serving platter. Spread with half the cream, then half the peaches. Cover with second cake and top with remaining peaches. Top with a dollop of cream and, if desired, a mint sprig. Serve immediately, with the Raspberry Melba Sauce on the side or drizzled over the cake.

** Pie Crust (Classic)
*** Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 - 3/4 cup solid veg. shortening
- 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water
*** Method
1. Combine the flour and salt in a food processor. Add the shortening; pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2. With the machine running,trickle in 4 tablespoons of ice water through the feed tube, until the dough just gathers together. (If the dough seems dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more of ice water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.)
3. Divide the dough in half, forming each half into a thick disk. Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill.
4. Remove half the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. (Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky.) With the help of a spatula, gently transfer the dough to a pie plate, pressing it lightly into the plate to fit. If the dough should tear, just press it together gently. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. If making a single-crust pie, turn the edge under and flute it decoratively.
5. Repeat for a top crust or for another bottom crust. The diameter for a top crust should be one inch larger than for the pie.
6. Follow the individual pie recipes for filling and baking.

** Spoon Cookies
From Gourmet, Dec. 2005
Makes 25-30 sandwich cookies
*** Ingredients
- 2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 3/4 cup (148.5 grams) sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 2 cups (240 grams) flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/8 tsp salt, slightly rounded
- 1/2 cup fruit preserves (your choice: cherry and strawberry are good)
*** Method
1. Fill kitchen sink with about 2 inches of cold water. Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter turns golden with a nutlike fragrance and flecks on bottom of pan turn a rich caramel brown, 10 to 12 minutes. (Butter will initially foam, then dissipate. A thicker foam will appear and cover the surface just before butter begins to brown; stir more frequently toward end of cooking.) Place pan in sink to stop cooking, then cool, stirring frequently, until butter starts to look opaque, about 4 minutes. Remove pan from sink and stir in sugar and vanilla.
2. Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda and stir into butter mixture until a dough forms. Shape into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and let stand at cool room temperature 1 to 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop).
3. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
4. Press a piece of dough into bowl of teaspoon (table type teaspoon, not one for measuring), flattening top, then slide out and place, flat side down, on an ungreased baking sheet. (Dough will feel crumbly, but will become cohesive when pressed.) Continue forming cookies and arranging on sheet. Bake cookies until just pale golden, 8 to 15 minutes. Cool cookies on sheet on a rack 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Cookies are very delicate when hot.
5. While cookies cool, heat preserves in a small saucepan over low heat until just runny, then pour through a sieve into a small bowl, pressing hard on solids, and cool completely. Spread the flat side of a cookie with a thin layer of preserves. Sandwich with flat side of another cookie. Continue with remaining cookies and preserves, then let stand until set, about 45 minutes. Transfer cookies to an airtight contain and (this is the hard part) WAIT 2 DAYS BEFORE EATING.
6. Dough can be made 12 hours before baking and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature to soften slightly before forming cookies, about 30 minutes. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 2 weeks.

** Asparagus Frittata with Basil, Shallots and Parmesan
*** Ingredients
- 1 pound thin asparagus
- 2 Tbls extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium shallots, minced (onions will do in a pinch!)
- 6 large eggs -- egg beaters work just fine!
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (I use Pecorino Romano)
- 1/4 cup shredded fresh basil leaves (I use 1 tsp dried)
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
*** Method
1. Snap and discard tough asparagus ends. Slice the asparagus on the bias into 1-inch-long pieces. Steam the asparagus in a bamboo steamer (or boil in salt water for 1 1/2 minutes), until almost tender.
2. Preheat the broiler. Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet with an oven proof handle. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Add the shallots and saute over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook for 30 seconds. 
3. In a medium bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs, cheese, basil and salt and pepper. Add the egg mixture to the pan and stir gently with a fork to incorporate the vegetables. Cook over medium-low heat, occasionally sliding a spatula around the edges of the pan to loosen the frittata as it sets. Continue cooking until the frittata is set, except for the top, about 8 minutes.
4. Place the pan directly under the broiler and cook just until the top is golden brown and set, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not let the frittata burn.
5. Invert the frittata onto a large platter. (Optionally sprinkle with a little kosher salt.) Cut it into wedges and serve. The frittata may also be cooled to room temperature and then cut and served.

** Crispy Red Potatoes with Warm Asian Slaw & Limey Sauce
*** Overview
Welcome back to the Best Recipes of 2012! post-Thanksgiving edition. 4 days ago, most of us were no better than we should have been about the carbs, which is one of the reasons I saved this recipe till after the holiday.  The other is that it's the kind of recipe there's never enough of, and I figured there was no point in ratcheting up the level of family tension any more than necessary.
The book: The Fresh & Green Table, by Susie Middleton (Chronicle Books, $24.95 here's my complete review)
The recipe: Crispy Red Potato Patties with Asian Slaw and Limey Sauce
Why I tried it: I have yet to meet anyone who can resist a crisp potato, and I've long loved the way that roasting a potato gets you a whole lot of crunch with a minimum of oil.  Could there be another way to roast potatoes, other than the good ol' roasty chunks I learned to make from my trusty One Potato Two Potato?  The lime-and-gingery slaw sounded conventional, but it also seemed like a virtuous foil for the potatoes.
Why I loved it: First of all, the squashed potatoes have all kinds of surface area for crisping up, which they do with a vengeance.  Then it's lime, lime, lime.  Tart lime and zest juicing up the soft mayo, lime brightening the fine shreds of cabbage in the slaw, all of it balanced with curve-filling sweetness just where it needs it.  The slaw is great, and it makes you feel good about yourself. But it was the crispy little bits of potato, perfect for dipping in limey sauce, that we were all fighting over in the end.  (If you feel like saving yourself some trouble and just making the potatoes and sauce and skipping the slaw, I assure you the recipe will still rock your socks off, and no one will know.)
*** Time
- Estimated preparation time: 90 minutes, including a bit of downtime during which you can make the sauce and the slaw.
*** Crispy Red Potatoes
**** Ingredients
- 16 baby red potatoes of uniform size (about 1½ oz each)
- kosher salt
- ½ cup canola oil
**** Method
1. To cook the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 475 degreesF. Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a piece of parchment. Put a double layer of dish towels on a large cutting board or your counter. Arrange the potatoes (preferably in a single layer) in a large Dutch oven and add enough water to cover them by at least 1 1/2 inches. Add 2 tsp salt, cover loosely, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender all the way through but not falling apart (check with a paring knife), 18 to 20 minutes.
2. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer each potato to the dish towels, not touching, and let cool for a few minutes. Using another folded dish towel, gently press down on each potato to flatten it into a patty about 1/2 inch thick (or up to 3/4 inch). The patties don't have to be perfectly even, and a few pieces of potato may break off. (No matter; you can still roast them.) Let the patties cool for a few minutes more, transfer them to the baking sheet, and let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Or, at this point, you can hold the potatoes in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature before roasting.)
3. Sprinkle the potatoes with 1/4 tsp salt and pour the canola oil over them. Care fully flip the potatoes over and season again with a scant 1/2 tsp salt. Rub with some of the oil, making sure that the potatoes are well coated on all sides. Roast, carefully turning once with a spatula halfway through cooking, until they turn a deep orange brown (a little darker and crisper around the edges), 28 to 30 minutes.
*** The limey sauce:
**** Ingredients
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- ½ tsp finely grated lime zest
- ½ tsp finely minced garlic
- kosher salt
**** Method
1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until well combined. Let sit for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. Refrigerate if making ahead.
*** The Asian slaw:
- 1½ cups very thinly sliced napa or savoy cabbage (pale inner leaves only)
- 1 cup very thinly sliced red cabbage
- 1 cup (packed) baby spinach leaves
- kosher salt
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1½ tsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1½ tsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp canola oil, plus 2 tsp
- ½ medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp minced peeled fresh ginger
- ½ tsp minced garlic
- 2 tbsp thinly sliced scallions (white and green parts)
**** Method
1. To make the slaw: In a large heatproof mixing bowl, combine the napa cabbage, red cabbage, and spinach. Sprinkle the greens with 1/4 tSp salt. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, lime juice, and brown sugar. In a medium heavy nonstick skillet, heat the 2 tsp canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the red onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the onion is wilted and just starting to brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the onion to the bowl of greens and let the skillet cool for a few seconds off the heat.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the pan to the heat, and add the remaining 1 tbsp canola oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the vinegar mixture to the pan (scrape out all the brown sugar with a small spatula), stir vigorously to warm it through, and immediately remove the pan from the heat. Stir and scrape the hot dressing over the greens, tossing the greens with tongs as you pour. Toss thoroughly to coat well and to soften and wilt the greens just a bit. (The cabbage will still be crunchy.) Taste and add more salt (if desired).
3. Arrange four dinner plates on your counter. On one side of each plate arrange four potato patties, slightly overlapping. On the other side of eacplate, mound a quarter of the slaw. Spoon some of the limey sauce over the potatoes (down the middle of the rowof potatoes), and top each serving with the scallions. Serve right away.

** Dried Mushroom Soup with Barley
*** Ingredients
- 1/2 ounce dried mushrooms, such as porcini, shiitake, chanterelle and/or morel -- about 2/3 cup
- 6 cups boiling water
- 1 tsp canola or other vegetable oil
- 2 cups chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 1 cup carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms (about 10 oz.)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- pinch dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup raw pearl barley
- 1/4 cup dry shery or 2 tsp honey
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
*** Method
1. In a saucepan, cover the dried mushrooms with 6 cups boiling water. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside for at least 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, warm the oil in a soup pot on low heat. Add the onions and garlic, cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the celery and carrots and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the fresh mushrooms, increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring continuously, for about 3 minutes, until the mushrooms begin to release their jucies. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3. Drain the dried mushrooms, reserving the mushroom stock. Cut off and discard any tough stems, then rinse and chop the mushrooms. Strain the stock through a sieve or-- if dirt or sand is evident-- through a paper coffee filter. Add enough water to the stock to make 7 cups of liquid. 
4. Add the chopped dried mushrooms, mushroom stock, soy sauce, thyme, pepper, barley and optional sherry or honey to the pot of sauteed vegetables. Bring to a boil and then cover; reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
5. When ready to serve, add salt and pepper to taste. The soup should be brothy, so if it has cooked down and become thick, add a bit more water.

3. Drop a small bit of batter in the oil to test it – when it rises to the top and bubbles, the oil is ready.
4. Dip cauliflower florets in the batter and let the excess drip off before gently setting in the oil.
5. Fry for a few minutes on each side, then flip, repeating sides several times if necessary until you get a nice golden brown fried exterior.
6. The additional frying time helps make it a little crunchier, which I very much like.
7. Remove and set on a cooling rack with paper towels underneath (again, rather than putting it all on a plate or bowl with paper towels, this keeps it crispy vs. soggy).
**** Serving:
1. Toss the fried cauliflower with the sauce (enough just to cover) and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds for serving.
2. Serve with rice.
** General Tso's Tofu
Prep time 15 mins
Cook time 15 mins
Total time 30 mins
Serves: 4 servings
*** Ingredients
**** For the tofu:
- 1½ tablespoons honey
- 2 teaspoons Louisiana hot sauce, such as Crystal
- 1 block of regular or firm tofu, drained, pat dry, and cut into 1-inch squares
- 1 ½ tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2 to 3 tablespoons cornstarch (depending on how wet the tofu is)
- ⅓ cup peanut or canola oil, for shallow frying
**** For the rest of the dish:
- ½ teaspoon minced ginger
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 7 whole dried Chinese red chili peppers (optional)
- ½ of a red bell pepper, cut into large pieces
- ½ tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 1 cup water or vegetable stock
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1½ tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1½ tablespoons cornstarch, mixed with 1 tablespoon water
*** Instructions
1. Mix the honey and Louisiana hot sauce in a bowl until well combined. Add the tofu to the bowl, and toss together gently with a spatula until the tofu is well-coated.
2. Next, sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tofu, and toss until evenly distributed. Next, sprinkle the cornstarch over the tofu until lightly coated. If the tofu is still too wet, add a little more cornstarch.
3. Heat ⅓ cup oil in a medium-sized frying pan (we like to use a cast iron skillet) until the oil is about 350F, or when a bamboo chopstick bubbles when inserted into the oil. If you want to make the tofu frying easier, use more oil to achieve a deep fry.
4. Carefully place the tofu pieces into the pan, ensuring that the pieces are not touching, and let fry for about 2 minutes. Turn them over to continue frying on the other side. Work quickly and turn the heat down if you need more time for turning, or if you see they are starting to burn. Continue to cook the tofu until a nice crust is formed, and they turn golden brown (about 4-5 minutes time in total). Transfer the tofu pieces to a sheet pan with a slotted spoon.
5. Heat your wok over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil left from tofu-frying, and add the ginger. After 10 seconds, add the garlic and the whole dried chili peppers, and stir for 15 seconds. Next, stir in the red bell peppers and Shaoxing wine.
6. Now add the water or vegetable stock, and let the mixture come up to a boil. Add the broccoli florets.
7. Immediately add the soy sauces, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and sesame oil. Let the mixture come up to a boil. Immediately add the cornstarch mixture slowly while stirring.
8. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Feel free to add more or less of the cornstarch mixture depending on how thick you like your sauce, but give it 30 seconds to 1 minute between additions, as it does take some time for the sauce to thicken.
9. Toss in your fried tofu and give everything a quick stir to make sure the tofu is coated. Serve with steamed rice!

** Refried Bean, Zucchini and Corn Gratin
*** Ingredients
**** for the beans
- 3 cups simmered black beans or pinto beans, with liquid (see recipe)
- 2 tablespoons grapeseed or sunflower oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground
- 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon mild or hot chili powder (more to taste)
**** for the squash:
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ½ cup minced onion
- Salt to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 ½ pounds zucchini or mixed zucchini and yellow squash, sliced about 1/4 inch thick
- ½ to 1 teaspoon oregano, preferably Mexican oregano, to taste
**** for the corn
- 2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 1 serrano chile, minced
- ¼ cup cornmeal or polenta
- Salt to taste
- ½ cup grated asadero, Monterey Jack or pecorino
- ¼ cup crumbled queso cotijo, queso fresco, or feta
- 1 tablespoon butter or extra virgin olive oil
*** Method
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Oil or butter a 2-quart baking dish or gratin dish.
2. Refry beans: Drain off about 1/2 cup of liquid from beans, retaining it in a separate bowl to use later for moistening beans, should they dry out. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan and add ground cumin and chili. Cook, stirring over medium heat, for about a minute, until the spices begin to sizzle and cook. Add beans and optional chipotle. Fry beans, stirring and mashing with the back of a spoon, until they thicken and form a thin crust on the bottom of the pan. Stir up crust and mix into the beans. Cook until beans are thick but not dry, about 10 minutes. Add liquid you saved from the beans if they seem too dry. Taste refried beans and adjust salt (they probably won't need any as the broth reduces when you refry them). Spread in an even layer in the baking dish. (Note: If you use canned beans, do not drain. The frying process will go more quickly.)
3. Clean and dry skillet. Heat over medium heat and add olive oil. Add onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add squash, oregano, salt and pepper, and turn up heat slightly. Cook, stirring often or tossing in pan, until squash is translucent and tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Spread in an even layer over the beans.
4. Combine corn and milk in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer 5 minutes, until corn is just tender. Stir in cornmeal and minced serrano, add salt to taste, and continue to simmer until mixture is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in grated cheese. Remove from heat and spread in an even layer over squash. Sprinkle crumbled cheese over top. Dot with butter or drizzle on oil.
5. Place in oven and bake 25 minutes, until bubbly and crumbled cheese is lightly browned. Serve hot or warm.
**** Tip
Advance preparation: The refried beans will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator, but you will need to moisten them before you assemble the gratin.

** Roasted Eggplant, Crisp Garlic, and Basil Pasta
*** Ingredients
- 8 medium baby japanese eggplant (or 1 Globe eggplant) ends trimmed
- 6 tablespoons olive oil divided plus more for garnish
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme (or oregano) leaves stripped
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 6 medium garlic cloves thinly sliced
- 1 (14-ounce) can tomato puree
- 1 tablespoon balsamic or sherry vinegar
- 1 teaspoon unrefined cane sugar (optional)
- 12 ounces spaghetti
- 3 ounces feta or goat cheese crumbled
- 1 handful fresh basil leaves thinly sliced
*** Method
1. Heat oven to 450 degreesF and arrange a rack in the middle. Slice baby eggplant lengthwse or cut larger eggplant into 1-inch cubes then combine with half of the olive oil and the thyme or oregano. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss to combine. Spread on a silicone baking mat or foil-lined baking sheet in one even layer and roast, stirring a few times, until soft and golden brown, about 20 to 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile,  bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat.
3. In a large frying pan, heat the remaining oil over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add garlic and cook until garlic is crisp, golden brown, and fragrant. Remove garlic to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.
4. Return pan with olive oil to the stove over medium heat and add the tomatoes and vinegar, sugar, season with salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes
5. Meanwhile, when the water boils, cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain pasta. Set aside.
6. Add eggplant to pasta sauce and simmer until heated through. Taste, and, add more vinegar if the sauce is sweet, or, as needed, add sugar to make the sauce sweeter.
7. Add reserved pasta to pasta sauce and stir to coat. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and stir until each piece of pasta is just coated with the sauce. Add additional pasta water as needed to help the sauce coat the pasta. Remove from heat, top with cheese, basil, and crisp garlic and season with additional salt and pepper, as desired. Finish pasta with a drizzle of additional olive oil and serve.

** Southwestern Quiche With Potato Crust 
*** Ingredients
- 6 large eggs
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1.5 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 1/2 medium red bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels, thawed if frozen
- 2 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
- 3/4 cup shredded or crumbled Cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup low-fat milk
- 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, w/ 2 tsp. sauce reserved
*** Method
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat the pie dish with cooking spray. Whisk together 1 egg and 1/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Stir in shredded hash browns. Press the potato mixture into the bottom and sides of the pie dish to form crust. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
2. Sprinkle the bell pepper, corn, green onions, cilantro, and cheese over the potato crust.
3. In a blender, mix together the remaining eggs, milk, 3/4 tsp. salt, chiles and adobo sauce. Pour mixture over vegetables in pie dish. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
4. Serves 6.
5. I served the quiche topped with avocado slices and good store-bought salsa (I had Mrs. Renfro's Black Bean Salsa on hand). It was quite tasty, and everyone wanted seconds. I'll make this again, but I think next time I'll serve it with some black beans or a salad on the side, to add some fiber, and maybe add a third chipotle pepper (love the smokey flavor they add).

** Pizza
*** Master Dough with Starter
Makes about 29 ounces (820 grams) dough, enough for 2 pizzas This is what I'd call the quintessential American pizza dough, inspired by New York–style pizza: medium thin, satisfyingly chewy, and the ideal companion to mozzarella, tomato sauce, and the pizza toppings Americans love best, from pepperoni and sausage to olives, mushrooms, and other vegetables. It's the dough I teach first to new students, and the one I recommend experimenting with because it's so versatile and user-friendly.
**** Ingredients
- 2.2 grams (3/4 teaspoon) active dry yeast
- 70 grams (1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon) warm water (80 degreesF to 85 degreesF)
- 453 grams flour (3-1/2 cups) with 13 to 14 percent protein, preferably All Trumps, Pendleton Flour Mills Power, Giusto's High Performer, King Arthur Sir Lancelot Unbleached Hi-Gluten, or Tony's California Artisan Flour
- 10 grams (1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon) diastatic malt
- 210 grams (3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ice water, plus more as needed
- 90 grams Poolish (see sidebar) or Tiga (see sidebar)
- 10 grams (2 teaspoons) fine sea salt
- 5 grams (1 teaspoon) extra virgin
- olive oil
**** Method
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the warm water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The yeast should dissolve in the water and the mixture should foam. If it doesn't and the yeast granules float, the yeast is “dead” and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.
2. Combine the flour and malt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
3. With the mixer running on the lowest speed, pour in most of the icewater, reserving about 2 tablespoons, followed by the yeast-water mixture. Pour the reserved water into the yeast bowl, swirl it around to dislodge any bits of yeast stuck to the bowl, and add to the mixer. Mix for about 15 seconds, stop the mixer, and add the poolish or tiga.
4. Continue to mix the dough at the lowest speed for about 1 minute, until most of the dough comes together around the hook. Stop the mixer. Use your fingers to pull away any dough clinging to the hook, and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a bowl scraper or rubber spatula. Check the bottom of the bowl for any unincorporated flour. Turn the dough over and press it into the bottom of the bowl to pick up any stray pieces. If the dough isn't holding together, add small amounts of water (about 1/2 teaspoon to start) and mix until the dough is no longer dry and holds together.
5. Add the salt and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute to combine.
6. Stop the mixer, pull the dough off the hook, and add the oil. Mix the dough for 1 to 2 minutes, stopping the mixer from time to time to pull the dough off the hook and scrape down the sides of the bowl, until all of the oil is absorbed. The dough won't look completely smooth.
7. Use a bowl scraper to transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface, then knead it for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp dish towel and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Use the dough cutter to loosen the dough and to cut it in half.  Weigh the dough, adjusting the quantity as necessary to give you two 13-ounce pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Any remaining dough can be discarded.
8. Form the dough into balls. Set the balls on a half sheet pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Or, if you will be baking the balls on different days, place each ball on a quarter sheet pan. Wrap the pan(s) airtight with a double layer of plastic wrap, sealing the wrap well under the pan(s). Put the pan(s) in a level spot in the refrigerator and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.
*** TIGA and POOLISH Starters
Here are the two starters I use most frequently in this book and in my restaurants. Tiga is my slightly more hydrated version of a classic biga starter, which is usually between 50 and 60 percent water. This “Tony's biga,” which I call “Tiga,” has 70 percent hydration.
My poolish follows the traditional proportions of equal parts water and flour, so its hydration is much higher at 100 percent. In general, unless I specify otherwise, use the same flour in your starter that you will be using in your dough. I always make starters with cold water to slow down the fermentation process for greater flavor complexity. It's helpful to use a clear glass bowl so you can see how well your starter is fermenting.
**** TIGA
Makes 90 grams
***** Ingredients
- 0.14 gram (one-third of 1/8 teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.42 gram
  fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 39 grams (2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons) cold tap water
- 55 grams (1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe
***** Method
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesn't and the yeast granules float, the yeast is “dead” and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.
2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine. The consistency will be quite thick.
3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.
4. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours. Bring it to cool room temperature before using.
**** POOLISH
Makes 90 grams
***** Ingredients
- 0.12 gram (one-third of 1/8 teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.36 gram
  fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 47 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold tap water
- 47 grams (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe
***** Method
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesn't and the yeast granules float, the yeast is “dead” and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.
2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine. The consistency will be quite thick, resembling a thick pancake batter.
3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.
4. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours. Bring to cool room temperature before using.

** Ultimate Veggie Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. Sprouted garbanzos are becoming more readily available, but if you can't find them, canned or cooked garbanzos (chickpeas) will work great. Sprouting boosts their already fantastic nutritional value even more...
*** Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups sprouted garbanzo beans (chickpeas) OR canned garbanzos, drained and rinsed
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 onion, chopped
- Grated zest of one large lemon
- 1 cup micro sprouts, chopped (try brocolli, onion, or alfalfa sprouts - optional)
- 1 cup toasted (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
Method:
1. If you are using sprouted garbanzos, steam them until just tender, about 10 minutes. Most of you will be using canned beans, so jump right in and combine the garbanzos, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a very thick, slightly chunky hummus. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the cilantro, onion, zest, and sprouts. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.
3. Makes 12 mini burgers.

** Vegetarian Lentil Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. I use black lentils in this recipe, some of the other types of lentils are too mushy when cooked - so I'd stick with the black lentils. Feel free to spice up the batter by experimenting with your favorite seasonings.
*** Ingredients
- 3 cups cooked black lentils
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup toasted fine (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
*** Method
1. Combine the lentils, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a runny yet textured hummus - it's o.k. if many of the lentils remain whole (see photo). Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the onion. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a very moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.

** Takeout Style Broccoli with Garlic Sauce
*** Yield
Serves: 4
*** Ingredients
- 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1½ teaspoons rice wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- ¾ cup hot chicken or vegetable stock (to keep the dish vegetarian)
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- A pinch of fresh ground white pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 cloves of minced garlic (about a tablespoon)
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- Cornstarch slurry (1½ tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 1½ tablespoons water)
- 1 teaspoon homemade chili oil (optional)
*** Method
1. Wash the broccoli thoroughly and set aside. Mix the soy sauces, rice wine vinegar, sugar, stock, sesame oil, and ground white pepper, and set aside.
2. Heat the wok over high heat. Add the vegetable oil, garlic, and broccoli and quickly stir-fry so the garlic doesn't burn.
3. Stir fry for 15 seconds, and add the Shaoxing rice wine around the perimeter of the wok. Give everything a quick stir and add in the sauce mixture. Let the sauce come to a boil, and mix the cornstarch and water together to make a slurry.
4. Add the cornstarch slurry slowly while stirring the broccoli and sauce constantly. Let the sauce cook and thicken until it coats the back of a spoon. If you like a thick sauce, add more cornstarch and water. If you like your sauce thinner, add less cornstarch and water. If you'd like, stir in the chili oil at this point. Serve!

** Champ
*** Ingredients
- 2 lbs. potatoes, unpeeled
- 2/3 cup milk
- 4-5 scallions, finely chopped
- 1/4- 1/2 cup butter
- salt and pepper
*** Method
1. Champ, also known as cally, poundies and pandy, is one of the most famous ways of serving Ireland's best loved vegetable--the potato. Champ is the country's way of serving mashed potatoes.
2. Heat a pan of salted water and boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Drain and dry over low heat covered with a paper towel. Peel and mash well.
3. While the potatoes are cooking, put the milk and chopped scallions into a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer for a few minutes. Gradually beat the milk and onion mixture into the mashed potatoes to form a soft, but not sloppy, mixture. Beat in half the butter and searson with salt pepper. Divide among 4 warm plates or bowls. Make a well in the center of each serving, cut the remaining butter into 4 pieces, and put one piece in each of the hollows. Serve immediately.
4. Cook's notes:
5. Traditionally, champ would have been served as a main meal, with a glass of milk or buttermilk. Today, however, it is used to acocompany meats such as boiled ham and broiled sausages. Parsley, young nettle tops, peas and fava beans can be substituted for the scallions.
6. Serves 4.
7. Prep time: 5 minutes
8. Cooking time: 20-25 minutes

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped scallion
- 3/4 cup cubed cooked potato
- 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower florets

2. Drain, rinse in cold water, drain again, then combine with vegetables in a large bowl.
3. Combine black pepper, coconut milk, rice wine vinegar and curry powder in a blender and turn machine on; a creamy emulsion will form within 30 seconds. Taste and add more vinegar a teaspoon or two at a time until balance tastes right to you, then add more curry powder, salt, or pepper, if needed.
4. Drizzle vinaigrette over rice and vegetables.
5. Use 2 big forks to combine, fluffing rice and tossing gently to separate grains.
6. Stir in chili, if using, and cilantro, taste, and adjust seasoning or moisten with a little more dressing.
7. Serve at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to a day, bringing salad back to room temperature before serving.

1. Combine garlic, 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle or food processor; process until smooth. Mix in mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, tomato paste, 1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper until combined. Cover and refrigerate dipping sauce.
2. Mix 1 tablespoon salt, black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl. Set spice blend aside.
3. Pour water into a large saucepan and stir 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, cumin, and bay leaves into water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover; simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Stir potatoes into water-paprika mixture, bring to a boil, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not fully cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. The tip of a paring knife should easily insert into the center of a potato cube. Drain potatoes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add cooled potato cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to cool slightly. Toss in a bowl with spice blend and serve with dipping sauce.

** Soup of Bitter Greens with Cheese Dumplings
*** Ingredients
- 1 cup parmesean cheese
- 1 cup pecorino romano cheese
- 3/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs
- 1 Tblsp parsley
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 Tblsp olive oil

- (e.g., escarole, chickory)
- 2 quarts broth
*** Method
1. In a large bowl combine parmesean, romano, bread crumbs, parley, eggs and half of the garlic. Stir until a soft dough forms. Using moistened hands, roll the mixture in to  3/4 inch balls and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Refrigerate about 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the remaining garlic and cook over moderately high heat, about 30 seconds. Add the greens and cook, stirring, until wilted and just beginning to brown, about 3-4 minutes longer.
3. Add the stock and bring to simmer. Drop the dumplings into the stock and cook until they rise to the surface, about 5 minutes.
4. Season with salt and pepper and serve in deep bowls, passing extra pecorino at the table. 
5. Make ahead: the uncooked dumplings may be made overnight.
