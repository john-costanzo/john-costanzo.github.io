* Champ

** Ingredients:
- 2 lbs. potatoes, unpeeled
- 2/3 cup milk
- 4-5 scallions, finely chopped
- ¼-½ cup butter
- salt and pepper

** Method:
1. Champ, also known as cally, poundies and pandy, is one of the most famous ways of serving Ireland's best loved vegetable--the potato. Champ is the country's way of serving mashed potatoes.
2. Heat a pan of salted water and boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Drain and dry over low heat covered with a paper towel. Peel and mash well.
3. While the potatoes are cooking, put the milk and chopped scallions into a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer for a few minutes. Gradually beat the milk and onion mixture into the mashed potatoes to form a soft, but not sloppy, mixture. Beat in half the butter and searson with salt pepper. Divide among 4 warm plates or bowls. Make a well in the center of each serving, cut the remaining butter into 4 pieces, and put one piece in each of the hollows. Serve immediately.
4. Cook's notes:
5. Traditionally, champ would have been served as a main meal, with a glass of milk or buttermilk. Today, however, it is used to acocompany meats such as boiled ham and broiled sausages. Parsley, young nettle tops, peas and fava beans can be substituted for the scallions.
6. Serves 4.
7. Prep time: 5 minutes
8. Cooking time: 20-25 minutes

* Gougeres
Makes 16

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper (black works too)
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 4 eggs at room temperature
- 3/4 cup to 1 1/2 cups finely shredded gruyere cheese (about 2 oz) - you can experiment with different kinds of cheese

** Method:
1. Place water, butter, salt and pepper in heavy medium saucepan.  Heat over medium heat stirring
   until butter is melted and mixture boils. 
2. Stir in flour all at once.  Beat  with wooden spoon over heat until begins to form a ball, about
   1 minute. 
3. Remove from heat and beat until slightly cooled about 30 seconds.
4. Add eggs to flour mixture one at a time while beating with electric hand mixer between each
   addition until mixture has a dull satiny sheen. 
5. Stir in cheese until well blended.
6. Butter and flour large baking sheet, or line with parchment paper.  Drop warm paste by heaping
   tablespoonfuls onto baking sheet at least 2 inches apart. 
7. Bake until very well browned at 350 degrees, about 35 minutes.  It could take longer for them to
   be well browned. 
8. Remove from oven and transfer to wire rack.  Cut tiny slit in side of each puff to allow steam to
   escape. 
9. These are best eaten the day they are baked.  You can freeze them on the baking sheet before
   cooking (add 10 minutes to cooking time) or heat them briefly to crisp them up again if you make
   them the previous day.

4. Drizzle vinaigrette over rice and vegetables.
5. Use 2 big forks to combine, fluffing rice and tossing gently to separate grains.
6. Stir in chili, if using, and cilantro, taste, and adjust seasoning or moisten with a little more dressing.
